For an animation to take effect, an Animation node definition must include a child field interpolator node ([FloatFieldInterpolator](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/floatfieldinterpolator.md\"FloatFieldInterpolator\"), [Vector2DFieldInterpolator](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/vector2dfieldinterpolator.md\"Vector2DFieldInterpolator\"), [ColorFieldInterpolator](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/colorfieldinterpolator.md\"ColorFieldInterpolator\")) definition for each renderable node field that is animated.\n\nThe Animation node class provides a simple linear interpolator function, where the animation takes place smoothly and simply from beginning to end. The Animation node class also provides several more complex interpolator functions to allow custom animation effects. For example, you can move a graphic image around the screen at differing speeds and curved trajectories at different times in the animation by specifying the appropriate function in the easeFunction field (quadratic and exponential are two examples of functions that can be specified). The interpolator functions are divided into two parts: the beginning of the animation (ease-in), and the end of the animation (ease-out). You can apply a specified interpolator function to either or both ease-in and ease-out, or specify no function for either or both (which is the linear function). You can also change the portion of the animation that is ease-in and ease-out to arbitrary fractional values for a quadratic interpolator function applied to both ease-in and ease-out.",

Field interpolators are generally used as children of an Animation node. As the animation progresses, it sets the fraction field of its field interpolators to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the fraction of the animation progress. The keyframe fields of the interpolator are key, the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and keyValue, the value that the field should have at that fraction of the animation.\n\nFor example, if a ColorFieldInterpolator node had three keyframes:\n\n*   0.0, 0xFF0000FF (red)\n*   0.4, 0x00FF00FF (green)\n*   1.0, 0x0000FFFF (blue)\n\nWhen the interpolator fraction field value was 0.0 (that is, 0%), the color field value would be set to red. When the fraction field value was 0.4 (that is, 40%), the color field value would be set to green. When the fraction field value was 1.0 (that is, 100%), the color field value would be set to blue.\n\nFor values of the fraction field between 0.0 and 0.4 (such as 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValue field values for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to a color halfway between red and green. Similarly, when the fraction field value is between the second and third keys (that is, between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValue field values of the second and third keyframes.\n\nIf the first keyframe has a key field fraction value greater than zero, then the field value is equal to the keyValue field value of the first keyframe until the fraction field value reaches the first keyframe key field fraction value. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key field fraction value less than one, the color field value is set to the keyValue field value of the last keyframe, from when the fraction field value equals the last keyframe key field fraction value percentage, and will not change as the fraction field value increases from that value to 1.0.\n\nThe ColorFieldInterpolator node class works in the HSV color space. Doing the interpolation in the HSV color space produces the most intuitive, visually pleasing results when animating color values.\n\n> While linear interpolation is used to compute the keyValue field values for fraction field values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the fraction field values computed by the Animation node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.",

            "description": "Extends [**Node**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/node.md\n\nVector2DFieldInterpolator specifies a keyframe animation sequence to be applied to a pair Vector2D field of a node. Most typically, this is used to animate the (x,y) coordinates of a node's translation field.\n\nAll field interpolators include a set of key/keyValue pairs that define a keyframe of the animation. Field interpolators are generally used as children of an Animation node. As the animation progresses, it sets the fraction field of its field interpolators to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the percentage of the Animation's progress. The keyframes of the interpolator include a \"key\", the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and a \"keyValue\", the value that the field should have at that percentage.\n\nFor example, if a Vector2DFieldInterpolator had three keyframes, (0.0, \\[0.0, 0.0\\]), (0.4, \\[500.0, 0.0\\]) and (1.0, \\[500, 200.0\\]), then when the interpolator's fraction field was 0.0 (i.e. 0%), the field would be set to \\[0.0, 0.0\\]. When fraction was 0.4 (i.e. 40%), the field would be set to \\[500.0, 0.0\\]. When fraction was 1.0 (i.e. 100%), the field would be set to \\[500.0, 200.0\\].\n\nFor values of fraction between 0.0 and 0.4 (e.g. 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to \\[250.0, 0.0\\] (halfway between the point \\[0.0, 0.0\\] and \\[200.0, 0.0\\]. Similarly, when fraction is between the second and third keys (i.e. between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues of the second and third keyframes.\n\nFor this example, if the field being interpolated were the translation field of a Poster node parented to the Scene node, the Poster would originally be positioned with its top/left corner at the upper, left corner of the screen. As the animation proceeded from 0% to 40% complete, the Poster would slide horizontally to the right until it's top/left corner was at x=500.0, y=0.0. As the animation continued from 40% to 100% complete, the Poster would slide vertically down until its top/left corner was at x=500.0, y=200.0.\n\nIf the first keyframe has a key percentage greater than zero, then the field value will be equal to the keyValue of the first keyframe until fraction reaches the first keyframe's key percentage. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key percentage less than one, the field value will be set to the keyValue of the last keyframe from when fraction equals the the last keyframe's key percentage and will not change as fraction increases from that value to 1.0.\n\n> While linearly interpolation is used to compute the keyValue's for fraction values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the fraction values computed by the Animation node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.",

Many nodes and components require a ContentNode node as the specification of their content field in order to be properly configured. In general, lists, grids, and panels require a ContentNode node for configuration. The data included in a ContentNode node can be data such as the text for labels in the node or component, and the spacing between items in a list, grid, or panel, including data to create custom lists, grids, and panels. The reference information for every node or component that requires a ContentNode node includes a section that details the requirements of the ContentNode node for that node or component.\n\nContentNode nodes defined as the specification for a node or component content field are typically structured as one ContentNode parent node, with a hierarchy of child nodes that specify the actual data, and sections of data if needed. For example, a [LabelList](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/list-and-grid-nodes/labellist.md\"LabelList\") node can have several sections that divide the entire list, each with their own section heading, and specific items in that section of the list. The ContentNode node for that LabelList node should have two levels of child ContentNode nodes, one level for the data to configure the list sections, and then another level of child ContentNode nodes for the data for each item in that list section.\n\nA ContentNode node can also be used to specify the data for custom components with defined interfaces, and for nodes and components that require [Content Meta-Data](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/content-metadata.md \" Content Meta-Data\"). Also, you should use a ContentNode node for complex structures of data for your application rather than associative arrays. ContentNode node objects are passed by reference in the application, while associative array objects are copied. For large complex data structures, passing ContentNode node objects is much quicker than passing the equivalent associative array object. You can use associative arrays for simpler data structures with just a few fixed members.\n\n> All of the attributes listed in [Content Meta-Data](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/content-metadata.md \"Content Meta-Data\") can be set as fields in a Content node. However, when creating a Content node, the fields themselves are not created until the valid attributes are set as fields, using either assignment (=), or set using [setField()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifsgnodefield.mdsetfieldfieldname-as-string-value-as-object-as-boolean \"setField\") or [setFields()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifsgnodefield.mdsetfieldsfields-as-object-as-boolean. \"setFields()\")",

A Task node also allows you to run functions that cannot be run in SceneGraph node or component, typically BrightScript code functions involving operations such as reading data from servers and file system manipulation. (You also cannot, and should not, run functions in a SceneGraph application for operations that are functionally the same as SceneGraph nodes and components, such as playing videos.) A list of all the BrightScript functions and components that cannot be used in SceneGraph applications or can only be used in a Task node can be found in [BrightScript Support](/docs/developer-program/core-concepts/scenegraph-brightscript/brightscript-support.md \"BrightScript Support\").\n\nA Task node is typically used to read data from a server to create a ContentNode node to configure a SceneGraph node or component (see [ContentNode](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/control-nodes/contentnode.md\"ContentNode\")). A Task node used for this purpose can be thought of as a content reader. Since ContentNode nodes are required to configure many components rendered in a scene, such as lists, panels, and grids, and you will generally want to read the data for those types of nodes from your server, you should create a Task node as a content reader for each of those components that you use in your scene.\n\nThe Task node class was designed with three general development use cases:\n\n*   A new Task node object is created for each asynchronous operation. The input data needed for the operation is set in the Task node object [<interface>](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/xml-elements/interface.md\"<interface>\") fields in the render thread, along with an observer of the output field data, and the Task node control field is set to RUN. After the output data is returned to the render thread, the Task node object is not used again.\n*   A Task node object is used multiple times for several identical asynchronous operations. In this case, the input data for each operation is set in the existing Task node object, with another observer for the output field data, and the Task node control field is again set to RUN. This may be more efficient than creating a new Task node object for each of the identical operations.\n*   A Task node observes its input fields using the port form of the ifSGNodeField [observeField()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifsgnodefield.mdobservefieldfieldname-as-string-functionname-as-string-as-boolean \"observeField()\") method, and returns output data with each field change. In this case, the Task node acts like a continuous server.\n\nSince Task nodes launch asynchronous threads, and have no provisions for locks and mutexes, you must be careful to avoid race, deadlock, and other asynchronous thread errors. Here are a few tips for using Task nodes:\n\n*   Avoid accessing files which must be persistent before thread completion, to avoid a subsequent Task node or other thread access of the same file before the thread completes. It is easier and safer to use a dynamically-created string or other data object to hold temporary thread data to avoid having a subsequent or existing thread overwrite and corrupt the data.\n*   Be very careful if you access any object in a Task node that may exist in another thread. It is better to completely separate all objects in any other possible thread from the Task node thread by setting the fields of the Task node with copies of the minimum amount of data needed to run the thread.\n*   In the Task node init() function, perform the minimum required amount of initialization of the Task node and any included thread functions. If you intend to trigger an asynchronous task based on a Task node input field change, in many cases, you should only set up the observer for the field in init().\n*   Use the port form of the ifSGNodeField [observeField()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifsgnodefield.mdobservefieldfieldname-as-string-functionname-as-string-as-boolean \"observeField()\") rather than the onChange attribute. This will avoid triggering the thread in response to a render thread event before the Task node observers are set up.\n*   It is more efficient to use a persistent Task node that is triggered by an field change than to create a new Task node every time a particular asynchronous thread is required. If needed, you can communicate that the particular asynchronous thread is no longer required through an field as well, either through the triggering field, or a special field used for control of the Task node.\n*   You can use a single Task node object to run any number of different asynchronous threads by setting the functionName field to the Task node function you want before setting the control field to RUN. If you do not use the input data fields to trigger running the thread, this is equivalent to calling an asynchronous function, and passing the input data fields as arguments to the function. The output data fields can likewise be considered as the return value of a asynchronous function call, but to avoid blocking you must observe the fields, or the state field, as a callback event to handle the results in the calling thread.\n\nAlso review \"[SceneGraph threads](/docs/developer-program/core-concepts/threads.md \"SceneGraph\")\" for in-depth information on using Task nodes most efficiently.",

This allows effects such as having a list fade out at the bottom to be easily created.\n\n> MaskGroup nodes do not work on all Roku players (specifically, MaskGroup nodes only work on players that support OpenGL). On players whose graphics do not support OpenGL, a MaskGroup node just renders its children without applying the extra alpha mask. For this reason, you should avoid using the MaskGroup node for anything other than decorative purposes, such as creating a fading effect at the bottom of the screen, where the user interface information value of the screen element is not affected by the lack of the MaskNode node rendering.\n\nUnlike other bitmaps, the MaskGroup node class does not work with 9-patch images. If the bitmap size does not match the group bounding rectangle, the edge rows of the mask are repeated as needed.\n\nFor example, suppose the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle has an origin at (0, 0), a width of 150 and a height of 80. If the mask bitmap were also 150 by 80, and the maskOffset and maskSize field values were left at their default values of \\[ 0, 0 \\], then each pixel of the mask bitmap would be applied to the corresponding pixel of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle. The figure below illustrates that case. On the right is a MaskGroup node that contains a Poster node. In the center is an alpha bitmap with the same size as the Poster node. On the right is the result of rendering the MaskGroup node with the image in the center used as a mask.\n\n![maskExample1](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/maskExample1.png \"maskExample1\")\n\nThe maskSize and maskOffset field values can be used to scale and offset the mask bitmap relative to the group coordinate system, as shown in the figure below. The mask is the same bitmap as in the figure above. In the below figure, the maskOffset field value has been set to (50, 30), offsetting the origin of the mask bitmap coordinate system relative to the origin of the MaskGroup node coordinate system 50 pixels to the left and 30 pixels down.The maskSize field value has been set to (100, 50), This causes the width of the mask bitmap to be scaled from 150 to 100, and the height of the mask bitmap to be scaled from 80 to 50, so that the mask right edge aligns with the right edge of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle, and the mask bottom edge aligns with the bottom edge of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle. The center of the figure shows the mask with the maskOffset and maskSize field values applied overlaid on top of the MaskGroup node. The right side of the figure shows the result of applying the mask to the MaskGroup node. Notice that the left column of pixels in the mask is used as the mask for all columns of the MaskGroup node that lie to the left of the mask, causing those columns to be rendered with full opacity. Similarly, and the top row of the mask is used as the mask for all rows of the MaskGroup node that lie above the mask, causing each of the rows to fade out on the right.\n\n![maskExample2](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/maskExample2.png \"maskExample2\")\n\nAs shown in above, the transformed mask may not overlay all the rendered pixels of the MaskGroup node. In that case, the leftmost (rightmost) columns of the mask bitmap are used as the mask for any MaskGroup node pixels that are to the left (right) of the transformed mask. The top (bottom) row of the mask bitmap is used as the mask for MaskGroup node pixels that are above (below) the transformed mask.",

A 2D matrix that describes how points in the local coordinate system can be transformed into the parent node coordinate system is constructed from the values of the translation, rotation, scale, and scaleRotateCenter fields.\n\nThe 2D matrix is computed using the values of these four fields in the following order:\n\n*   translating by the negative of the scaleRotateCenter field value\n*   scaling by the the scale field value\n*   rotating by the rotation field value\n*   translating by the the scaleRotateCenter field value\n*   translating by the translation field value\n\nIn matrix math terms, the overall 2D matrix is:\n\nM = C(-1) S R C T\n\nWhere:\n\n*   M is the total matrix\n*   C is a 2D translation matrix that describes the location of the scale/rotation center in the node's local coordinate system\n*   C(-1) is the inverse of C\n*   S is a 2D scaling matrix\n*   R is a 2D rotation matrix\n*   T is a 2D translation matrix\n\n> In nearly all cases, either the default values for these four fields will be used (in which case, the local coordinate system of the node is the same as the parent node coordinate system), or only a translation will be specified (in which, the local coordinate system is a simple offset from the parent node coordinate system).",

            "description": "Extends [**Group**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/layout-group-nodes/group.md\"**Group**\")\n\nThe TargetGroup node class associates a set of rectangular regions that children of the group will occupy. Like MarkupList, the TargetGroup has a content field containing the data for each item and an itemComponentName field that specifies an RSG component that will be used to render a content item. It also has a targetSet field that contains a [TargetSet](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/list-and-grid-nodes/targetset.md\"TargetSet\") that define a set of rectangular targets where children of the TargetGroup will be rendered.\n\nThe TargetGroup node is typically used to create a scrolling list (or row) of items where the focused item occupies more space than the other items.\n\nFor example, a TargetGroup could be used to create a full screen vertical scrolling list of item where the focused item is larger than the other items in the list. As the list items scroll, the appearance of the item moving into the focus region would be dynamically adjusted to fill the larger focus region. Simultaneously, the appearance of the item leaving the focus region would be dynamically adjust to return to the unfocused size. To set up this use case, you might set the targetSet field to a TargetSet node that specifies nine rectangles. The first rectangle would be specified to have the width and height of an unfocused item and be positioned so that it's bottom is above the top of the screen. The last rectangle would be specified to have the width and height of an unfocused item and be positioned so that's top is below the bottom of the screen. The remaining seven rectangles would define the rectangular regions of the onscreen items. Suppose the design calls for the focus item to be centered vertically at the center of the screen. To do that, you would specify the 5th rectangle to be larger than the other eight and position it so that it is centered vertically, you would specify the remaining rectangles to form a column of rectangular regions where the top three and bottom three visible items would be located.\n\nThe second step of setting up this use case would be to implement an RSG component that will be used to render each item. The TargetGroup node manages the creation of the items for the visible components, associates each with a ContentNode, and updates fields of the item component with information such as the current width and height of the item and the focus status of the item.\n\nThe TargetGroup's jumpToItem field is set to identify which content item is to be located at the TargetSet's targetRects field target rectangle identified by the TargetSet's focusindex field.\n\nThe final step of setting up this use case would be to create a VerticalList component that extends TargetGroup, sets up the TargetGroup's TargetSet node, and as the user presses up and down buttons on the remote, sets the TargetGroup's animateToTargetItem field to the prior or next index. Setting the animateToTargetItem field causes the displayed items to smoothly animate from their current target region to another target region, such that the specified index ends up at the TargetSet's target rectangle that is identified by the TargetSet's focusIndex field.\n\nThe above use case specifies the most common use case for the TargetGroup node, but only hints at the possible uses. For example, you could create your own RSG components with various custom behaviors. There might include:\n\n*   A list where all the items are small when the list does not have the focus, but when the list receives the focus, all of the items smoothly adjust their size and position so that the focus item is largest, the items on either side of the focus item are slightly larger than the unfocused size and the remaining items remain the same size as the unfocused items. To do this, you would create two TargetSet's in your RSG component, one that defines the regions when the list is unfocused and one that defines the regions when the list is focused. Initially, the TargetGroup's targetSet field would be set to the unfocused TargetSet node. Then, when the list is focused, the targetSet's animateToTargetSet field would be set to the focused TargetSet node, causing all of the target regions to smoothly animate to their new size and position, taking along the associated item component's with them.\n*   A horizontal scrolling list of items where the focused region floats across the screen as the user presses left/right until the focus region reaches the edge of the display, at which point the focus region remains stationary and the items scroll left or right. This would require the use of several TargetSet nodes (one for each possible position of the focus region). Initally, the TargetGroup's targetSet field would be set to one of these TargetSet's. Then while the focus region is not at one of the edges, key presses would set the animateToTargetSet field to animate the focus region to its next location. Once the focus region reaches an edge, another key press in the same direction would set the animateToTargetIndex field to cause the items to scroll so that the next content item occupies the focus region.\n*   A list where when an item is selected, all of the items fly off the screen while the selected item zooms up and moves to the center of the screen. To set up this use case, you would specify a TargetSet for when the list items are onscreen and another TargetSet for the onscreen location of the focused item and the offscreen locations where each items will disappear.\n*   A circular arrangement of a fixed number of items with the item at the 6 o'clock position being larger and having the focus. Note that in this case, no offscreen targets would be specified.",

For example, the DynamicKeyboard node uses a Key Definition File that matches the key layout of the [legacy Keyboard node](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/widget-nodes/keyboard.md.\n    \n    The [**DynamicCustomKeyboard** node](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/dynamic-voice-keyboard-nodes/dynamic-custom-keyboard.md enables developers to define a custom Key Definition File in order to configure the key layout. In the Key Definition File, the developer specifies the keys in each section and row of the keyboard. The keys support the characters in the Basic Latin, Latin 1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A, and Latin Extended-B blocks. This provides support for most Western European languages, including English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n    \n\n*   The [**VoiceTextEditBox**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/dynamic-voice-keyboard-nodes/voice-text-edit-box.md displays the text that has been entered or spoken. This node supports multiple voice entry modes for entering email addresses, passwords, street addresses, and PINs. This node currently supports voice entry in English only.\n\n> Developers should upgrade the [legacy keyboards](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/widget-nodes/keyboard.md in their channels to dynamic voice-enabled keyboards in order to leverage the following benefits:\n> \n> *   **Faster on-device sign-ups and sign-ins.** Enable customers to use voice entry to provide their information when subscribing to channels and logging in.\n>     \n> *   **Localized in-channel search**: Enable customers to search for content in their native language.\n>     \n> *   **Localized customer information entry**: Enable customers to enter their personal information in their native language.\n>",

The Key Definition Files for the classes derived from **DynamicKeyboardBase** (**DynamicKeyboard**, **DynamicPinPad**, and **DynamicMiniKeyboard**) are built-in and cannot be modified because the keyboard layout for these nodes is fixed. Conversely, the **DynamicCustomKeyboard** node requires developers to create the Key Definition File in order to implement a custom keyboard layout.\n\nThe Key Definition File is a single JSON object with the following six hierarchal objects (listed in order from the top to the bottom of the hierarchy):\n\n1.  [KeyLayout](#keylayout)\n2.  [Section](#section)\n3.  [Grid](#grid)\n4.  [Row](#row)\n5.  [Key](#key)\n6.  [KeySuggestions](#keysuggestions)\n\nProperties can be set at any level of the hierarchy and are used to determine the default values for the subparts at lower levels in the hierarchy. For example, setting the **keyboardHeight** property at the **KeyLayout** level will specify the default height of each **Row** in each **Grid** in each **Section** of the grid used. If a **Grid** specifies a **gridHeight** property, it is set as the default for each **Row** in that **Grid**. In both cases, if any **Row** in the **Grid** specifies a **rowHeight** property, that height will be used as the default for each **Key** in that **Row**.",

The KeyboardDialog node class includes an interrnal Keyboard node to allow the user to enter the string.\n\nThe KeyboardDialog allows you to add a title (by setting the Dialog title field), a help message (by setting the Dialog message field), and a set of action buttons (by setting the Dialog node buttons field). The bulletText and graphicUrl fields of the Dialog node should not be set. If those Dialog node fields are set, the layout of the dialog will likely not look correct.\n\nAlso, the KeyboardDialog node class inherits the behavior of the interrnal [Keyboard](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/widget-nodes/keyboard.md\"Keyboard\") node when the Options remote key is pressed. The Keyboard node class toggles between uppercase and lowercase letters when the Options remote key is pressed, to speed the entry of mixed-case strings by the user. Therefore, the optionsDialog field of the Dialog node class should not be set to true.\n\nTypically, you will want to set the KeyboardDialog node title field to prompt the user to enter the string, and add \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons by setting the Dialog node buttons field to \\[ \"OK\", \"Cancel\" \\], then observe the Dialog node class buttonSelected field to react when the user presses one of those buttons. At any time, the text field can be accessed to obtain the string entered by the user.\n\nAnother typical usage of the KeyboardDialog node class adds a \"Hide Text\" button, with an observer function set up to toggle the secureMode field of the Keyboard node internal TextEditBox node (that is, by toggling the value of the keyboard.textEditBox.secureMode field).",

The button can display a label and/or an icon, as well as a background image. Fields are provided to customize the label text and color depending on whether or not the button has the key focus. Similarly, the bitmaps used for the icon and background can be specified for both focused and unfocused button states.\n\nBy default, the background of the button is only shown when the button has the key focus. Buttons are typically used in a ButtonGroup node that manages which button in the group will have the key focus when the ButtonGroup node receives the focus. When the ButtonGroup node has the focus, the button in the group that has the focus will display the focusBitmapUri bitmap as its background. When the ButtonGroup node does not have the focus, it remembers which button in the group had the focus and sets that button showFocusFootprint field to true, causing it to a render a \"footprint\" bitmap as a visual indicator that it will be the focused button when the ButtonGroup node receives the focus again. All other buttons in the ButtonGroup node do not display a background image.\n\nWhen a Button node is created that is not a child of a ButtonGroup node, typically the showFootprintfield field should be set to true, so that the button always displays a background image.",

The contents of each grid item is an instance of an XML component specified by the `itemComponentName` field. An instance of the XML component is used to display the data for each item in the grid data model. The appearance of the grid item as it enters/exits the grid focus position can be customized using scripting. [SimpleMarkupList.zip](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/blob/master/ux%20components/lists%20and%20grids/SimpleMarkupList.zip) is a sample channel containing a MarkupGrid where each item is an instance of an XML component. See the section [MarkupGrid XML component](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/list-and-grid-nodes/markupgrid.mdmarkupgrid-xml-component) for details.\n\nThe number of columns in the MarkupGrid node is fixed and the number of rows varies as needed to display all of the items in the grid data model. The items in the grid fill each row from left to right, then top to bottom. For example, if the grid data contains 8 items and the number of columns is set to 3, then items 1, 2 and 3 will be in the first row. Items 4, 5 and 6 will be in the second row. The third row will contain items 7 and 8 in the leftmost two columns and blank space in the right column.\n\nThe layout of rows and columns in the grid is very flexible. Possible layouts include:\n\n*   a simple layout with all items in the grid having the same size\n*   a layout with the items in some rows having varying heights and/or the items in some columns having varying widths\n*   a layout with varying width rows and columns and items that occupy one or more rows and columns\n\nThe grid items can be organized into sections that are demarcated by labelled horizontal divider lines between the sections.",

The RowList node class includes interface fields for customizing the appearance as the user scrolls up and down through the rows.\n\nLike those node classes, the RowList node class provides special interface fields to the item components to allow custom appearance and animations as the user scrolls left and right through the items in a row.\n\n> You can use the [ZoomRowList](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/list-and-grid-nodes/zoomrowlist.md node class to enlarge the row in the RowList that currently has focus. In addition to providing a zoomed focus row, the ZoomRowList features custom row item and row decoration components, unique zooming amounts for individual rows, and separate heights for zoomed/unzoomed row items.",

The PanelSet node manages the position of a set of child Panel nodes, and implements the left and right panel sliding behavior. Once a Panel node has been added to a PanelSet node, it remains a child of the PanelSet node unless it is replaced by another Panel node, or slides completely off the right side of the screen.\n\nThe PanelSet node is designed to display two Panel nodes in most cases, one Panel node on the left and one on the right. When the PanelSet node has focus, and the user presses the **Left** (or **Back**) or **Right** remote control key, the panels slide to the left or right one position.\n\nFor example, suppose the PanelSet node has two Panel nodes as children, panel A and panel B. When the user presses the **Right** key, a new panel, panel C, should be created and added as a child of the PanelSet node. Adding a panel as a child of the PanelSet node causes all the panels to slide left one position, so that panel A is now offscreen to the left, panel B is in the left position, and panel C is in the right position. If the user presses the **Right** key again, a new panel, panel D, should be created and added as a child node of the PanelSet node. Adding panel D causes the panels to slide left again so that panels A and B are offscreen to the left, panel C is in the left position, and panel D is in the right position.\n\nAt this point, if the user presses the **Left** key (or **Back** key), the panels will slide one position to the _right_, _back_ towards the original home position, so panel D will slide offscreen to the right, panel C will slide to the right position, and panel B will slide to the left position (panel A is still offscreen to the left). When the sliding animation ends, since panel D is offscreen to the right, it is automatically removed as a child node of the PanelSet node.",

The specific palette values used by those nodes are defined in each node's documentation.\n\nIf a node that supports a palette does not set its **palette** filed, the RSGPalette is inherited from ancestor nodes in the scene graph. Specifically, the node looks up the scene graph until it finds a **PaletteGroup** node with its **palette** field set. This may be found in the **Scene** itself.\n\nIf no node in the scene graph has its **palette** field set, the keyboard uses the default palette (gray background/white text).\n\nCurrently, the **RSGPalette** node is typically used in channels that customize the colors of the dynamic keyboard nodes. In this case, the channel assigns the RSGPalette node to the **palette** field of the [DynamicKeyboardBase](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/dynamic-voice-keyboard-nodes/dynamic-keyboard-base.md\"DynamicKeyboardBase\") node and lets the keyboard's **DynamicKeyGrid** and **VoiceTextEditBox** inherit that RSGPalette.\n\n> The colors in the RSGPalette do not cascade.

Bitmaps can be used for a variety of purposes, such as for sprites, compositing, or as double buffers.\n\nIt stores four color channels: red, green, blue, and alpha, with 32-bits per pixel. They can be any arbitrary size up to 2048x2048. However, the maximum size bitmap uses 16MB of memory, so there are practical memory limitations which would compel smaller bitmap sizes. Coordinates (x,y) for 2D bitmaps have an origin (0,0) at the top left. roBitmap is always offscreen. The top roScreen is the only ifDraw2D surface which is displayed. roBitmap represents something that can be drawn onto, as well as something that can be drawn.\n\nDrawing operations into a roBitmap (or other surface with ifDraw2D interface, such as an [roScreen](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/components/roscreen.md\"roScreen\")) are clipped so the only the part that is within its bounds is rendered. X,Y coordinates that specify a location in a bitmap to render to (for example, as used by DrawObject() or DrawText() ) may be positive or negative. Negative implies that the left and top of the rendered object will be clipped.The same bitmap cannot be used as a source and a destination in a single DrawObject() call.\n\nThere are limitations when using the onscreen bitmap as a source. For example, Alpha blending may not work.\n\nAn empty roBitmap object can be created with CreateObject():\n\n`CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", bitmapProps As Object)`\n\nbitmapProps is an roAssociativeArray with Integers width (Integer), height (Integer), and AlphaEnable (Boolean), and name (String) parameters. The contents of an empty RoBitmap are initialized to zero (transparent black).\n\nExample: `CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", {width:10, height:10, AlphaEnable:false, name:\"MyBitmapName\"})`\n\nAn roBitmap can also load its image data from a file:\n\n`CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", String filename)`\n\n**Example**\n\n```\n' Draw three bitmaps as fast as we can\n'\nScreen=CreateObject(\"roScreen\")\nbm1=CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", \"pkg:/images/myphoto1.jpg\")\nbm2=CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", \"pkg:/images/myphoto2.jpg\")\nbm3=CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", \"pkg:/images/myphoto3.jpg\")\nbmarray=[bm1, bm2, bm3]\nWhile true\n    For each bitmap in bmarray\n        Screen.DrawObject(0,0, bitmap)\n        Screen.Finish()\n    End for\nEnd While\n```\n\n**Example: Double buffering with roBitmap**\n\n```\nscreen1=CreateObject(\"roScreen\")\noff=CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", {width:1280, height:720, AlphaEnable:false})\noff.Clear(white)\ndfDrawImage(off, \"pkg:/images/myimage.png\", 50, 50)\noff.DrawRect(150, 150, 200, 200, &hFF) ' black, alpha: all source\nscreen1.DrawObject(0, 0, off)\nScreen1.Finish()\n```"

Now channels that use roVideoPlayer embedded in an roScreen or roImageCanvas can also take advantage of Roku's closed captioning support. roCaptionRenderer supports two different modes, which is set using the [SetMode()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifcaptionrenderer.mdsetmodemode-as-integer-as-void \"SetMode()\") method. Depending on the mode set, and the type of screen being used, the BrightScript channel needs to do different levels of work to render captions. These different workflows are highlighted in the tables below:\n\n**Model 1**\n\n| roScreen | roImageCanvas |\n| --- | --- |\n| Call [SetScreen()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifcaptionrenderer.mdsetscreenscreen-as-object-as-void \"SetScreen()\") | Call [SetScreen()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifcaptionrenderer.mdsetscreenscreen-as-object-as-void \"SetScreen()\") |\n| Call [UpdateCaption()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifcaptionrenderer.mdupdatecaption-as-void \"UpdateCaption()\") |  |\n\n**Model 2**\n\n| roScreen | roImageCanvas |\n| --- | --- |\n| All caption rendering is done by the channel's BrightScript code | All caption rendering is done by the channel's BrightScript code |\n\nBrightScript channels do not create roCaptionRenderer instances directly using CreateObject(). Instead, when an roVideoPlayer is created, it contains an roCaptionRenderer. BrightScript channels call [ifVideoPlayer.GetCaptionRenderer()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifvideoplayer.mdgetcaptionrenderer-as-object \"ifVideoPlayer.GetCaptionRenderer()\") to get the caption renderer associated with their video player.\n\n**Example**\n\n```\nFunction Main() as void\n  mode = 1\n  fonts = CreateObject(\"roFontRegistry\")\n  fonts.Register(\"pkg:/fonts/vSHandprinted.otf\")\n  font = fonts.GetFont(\"vSHandprinted\", 28, 500, false)\n  screen = CreateObject(\"roScreen\", true)\n  port = CreateObject(\"roMessagePort\")\n  screen.Clear(&h00)\n  screen.SwapBuffers()\n  screen.SetMessagePort(port)\n  timer = CreateObject(\"roTimespan\")\n  screenSize = {}\n  screenSize.width = screen.GetWidth()\n  screenSize.height = screen.GetHeight()\n\n  player = CreateObject(\"roVideoPlayer\")\n  player.SetContentList([\n    {\n        Stream : { url :\"http://ecn.channel9.msdn.com/o9/content/smf/smoothcontent/elephantsdream/Elephants_Dream_1024-h264-st-aac.ism/manifest\" }\n        StreamFormat : \"ism\"\n        TrackIDAudio: \"audio_eng\"\n        TrackIDSubtitle: \"ism/textstream_eng\"\n    }\n  ])\n\n  captions = player.GetCaptionRenderer()\n  if (mode = 1)\n    captions.SetScreen(screen)\n  endif\n  captions.SetMode(mode)\n  captions.SetMessagePort(port)\n  captions.ShowSubtitle(true)\n\n  player.play()\n\n  while true\n    msg = wait(250, port)\n    if type(msg) = \"roCaptionRendererEvent\"\n      if msg.isCaptionText()\n        print \"isCaptionText\"\n        if msg.GetMessage() <> invalid and msg.GetMessage() <> \"\"\n          DrawCaptionString(screen, screenSize, msg.GetMessage(), font)\n          timer.Mark()\n        else if timer.TotalSeconds() > 2\n          ClearCaptionString(screen)\n        endif\n      else if msg.isCaptionUpdateRequest()\n        print \"isCaptionUpdateRequest()\"\n        UpdateCaptions(screen, captions)\n      end if\n    endif\n  end while\nEnd Function\n\nFunction UpdateCaptions(screen as object, captions as object) as Void\n  screen.Clear(&h00)\n  captions.UpdateCaption()\n  screen.SwapBuffers()\nEnd Function\n\nFunction DrawCaptionString(screen as object, screenSize as object, caption as String, font as object) as Void\n  screen.Clear(&h00)\n  textHeight = font.GetOneLineHeight()\n  textWidth = font.GetOneLineWidth(caption, screenSize.width)\n  x = (screenSize.width - textWidth) / 2\n  y = screenSize.height - textHeight\n  screen.DrawText(caption, x, y, &hd5d522ff, font)\n  screen.SwapBuffers()\nEnd Function\n\nFunction ClearCaptionString(screen as object) as void\n  screen.Clear(&h00)\n  screen.SwapBuffers()\nEnd Function\n```",

Most of the purchase flow, screens and messaging associated with the financial transaction are handled by the Roku OS outside of control or monitoring by BrightScript code. The BrightScript code merely initiates the purchase and receives a final result. This will engender trust with users and give them confidence that they are dealing with the Roku Channel Store.\n\nThe roChannelStore component allows purchasing only those In-Channel Products which are associated with the running channel. Please see [Adding in-channel products](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/quickstart/in-channel-products.md \"Adding in-channel products\") for details on how to create an In-Channel Product and associate it with a channel. After one or Products are created, GetCatalog() can be used to retrieve a list of Products and their attributes. DoOrder() can be called to initiate a purchase of one or more of the Products.\n\nThe roChannelStore object has a FakeServer() method that will enable you to test the purchase flow scenarios without actually making a real transaction in the Roku channel store. This will be useful in the development of your channel, but should never be used in the actual channel you publish.\n\nThis object is created without any arguments:\n\n`CreateObject(\"roChannelStore\")`\n\n> Because [ifChannelStore.DoOrder()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifchannelstore.mddoorder-as-boolean \"ifChannelStore.DoOrder()\") needs to read the product type returned by GetCatalog(), only one instance of roChannelStore should ever be used for a complete purchase flow - you should never create a separate roChannelStore object to complete a purchase that was initiated by a different instance of roChannelStore."

There is an optional callout box in the lower right corner of the screen that can display details about the focused item without leaving the screen. Each item in the grid screen is represented by an image (aka poster), so any type of item that can be visually represented by an image can be displayed in the poster screen. It is used to show lists of data to users and common patterns include content categories, movies, podcasts, pictures, and search results. The initial release of roGridScreen only enabled the default list style, \"portrait\", using the following art sizes:\n\n*   Artwork sizes: SD=110x150; HD=210x270\n\nIt also required grid posters to be .jpg files.\n\nLater Roku OS versions added mixed aspect ratio grids, and the [ifGridScreen](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifgridscreen.md\"ifGridScreen\") interface [SetListPosterStyles()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifgridscreen.mdsetlistposterstylesstyles-as-object-as-void \"SetListPosterStyles()\") to set the aspect ratio of each row in the grid. If you want a mixed aspect ratio grid, you must call SetListPosterStyles() before you call [SetContentList()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifgridscreen.mdsetcontentlistrowindex-as-integer-contentlist-as-object-as-void \"SetContentList()\"), to avoid possible distortion of the graphic images in the grid.\n\n**Since Roku OS version 2.8**\n\nFile types of .png and .gif files are now supported, though they are converted internally to .jpg by the roGridScreen so they have a performance penalty.\n\nIn v2.8, there are now multiple grid styles that are specified in the SetGridStyle()method below. It's also worth going back and reviewing the appManager theme parameters in [roAppManager](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/components/roappmanager.md\"roAppManager\"), as v2.8 adds some new grid parameters. The border around the focused poster screen can be customized with the GridScreenFocusBorder images in png format. PNG files can have a transparent color value that you will need to allow the focused poster image to show through the border image. The corresponding offsets should be negative offsets that would be up and to the left of the top left corner of the poster image. The width of the borders should be the absolute values of the offsets and the rest of the image should be transparent inside. The GridScreenDescriptionImage is also positioned relative to the top left corner of the focused image. It can be positioned up and to the left with negative x and y offsets, below and to the right with positive offsets, or in the other corners with mixed signed x and y offsets. It's recommended that you include a \"callout\" tip pointing to the focused image in the GridScreenDescriptionImage.\n\n**Diagram: roGridScreen**\n\n![Diagram: roGridScreen](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/roGridScreen.png \"roGridScreen\")\n\nThis object is created with no parameters:\n\n`CreateObject(\"roGridScreen\")`\n\n**Example**\n\n```\nFunction Main()\n    port = CreateObject(\"roMessagePort\")\n    grid = CreateObject(\"roGridScreen\")\n    grid.SetMessagePort(port)\n    rowTitles = CreateObject(\"roArray\", 10, true)\n    for j = 0 to 10\n        rowTitles.Push(\"[Row Title \" + j.toStr() + \" ] \")\n    end for\n    grid.SetupLists(rowTitles.Count())\n    grid.SetListNames(rowTitles)\n    for j = 0 to 10\n    list = CreateObject(\"roArray\", 10, true)\n    for i = 0 to 10\n             o = CreateObject(\"roAssociativeArray\")\n             o.ContentType = \"episode\"\n             o.Title = \"[Title\" + i.toStr() + \"]\"\n             o.ShortDescriptionLine1 = \"[ShortDescriptionLine1]\"\n             o.ShortDescriptionLine2 = \"[ShortDescriptionLine2]\"\n             o.Description = \"\"\n             o.Description = \"[Description] \"\n             o.Rating = \"NR\"\n             o.StarRating = \"75\"\n             o.ReleaseDate = \"[<mm/dd/yyyy]\"\n             o.Length = 5400\n             o.Actors = []\n             o.Actors.Push(\"[Actor1]\")\n             o.Actors.Push(\"[Actor2]\")\n             o.Actors.Push(\"[Actor3]\")\n             o.Director = \"[Director]\"\n             list.Push(o)\n         end for\n         grid.SetContentList(j, list)\n     end for\n     grid.Show()\n     while true\n         msg = wait(0, port)\n         if type(msg) = \"roGridScreenEvent\" then\n             if msg.isScreenClosed() then\n                 return -1\n             elseif msg.isListItemFocused()\n                 print \"Focused msg: \";msg.GetMessage();\"row: \";msg.GetIndex();\n                 print \" col: \";msg.GetData()\n             elseif msg.isListItemSelected()\n                 print \"Selected msg: \";msg.GetMessage();\"row: \";msg.GetIndex();\n                 print \" col: \";msg.GetData()\n             endif\n         endif\n     end while\nEnd Function\n```",

For example, \"roList\" maintains a list of objects. If an Integer is added to roList, it will be automatically wrapped in an roInt by the language interpreter. When a function that expects a BrightScript Component as a parameter is passed an int, BrightScript automatically creates the equivalent BrightScript Component.\n*   If any object exposes the ifInt interface, that object can be used in any expression that expects an intrinsic value. For example, in this way an roTouchEvent can be used as an integer whose value is the userid of the roTouchEvent.\n\n> If o is an roInt, then the following statements have the following effects\n> \n> print o ' prints o.GetInt()\n> \n> i%=o ' assigns the integer i% the value of o.GetInt()\n> \n> k=o 'presumably k is dynamic typed, so it becomes another reference to the roInt o\n> \n> o=5 'this is NOT the same as o.SetInt(5). Instead it releases o, and 'changes the type of o to Integer (o is dynamically typed). And assigns it to 5.\n\n**Example**\n\n```\nBrightScript> o=CreateObject(\"roInt\")\nBrightScript> o.SetInt(555)\nBrightScript> print o\n555\nBrightScript> print o.GetInt()\n555\nBrightScript> print o-55\n500\n```"

The dialog may optionally be displayed with a busy animation to indicate progress on a long running operation. The dialog will automatically handle formatting of text and resize to fit. It may also display buttons to get user acknowledgment or a selection choice.\n\nThe following example shows an roMessageDialog with a single done button. When the title, text and button are added, the dialog automatically formats and resizes the dialog as needed for display when Show() is called.\n\n**Diagram: roMessageDialog**\n\n![Diagram: roMessageDialog](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/roMessageDialog.png \"roMessageDialog\")\n\n**Example**\n\nThe following code example creates a message dialog and displays it to the user. Note that dialogs are not full screen and that the previous screen is dimmed and displays in the background. When the user presses the message dialog button, the dialog is dismissed and the previous screen comes to the foreground. Since dialog.EnableBackButton(true) is also called, the message dialog is dismissed when the remote control's back button is pressed as well. You can of course add additional buttons to your message dialogs that do things other than dismiss the dialog. You would simply need to implement button specific event handling code for these cases in the dlgMsg.isButtonPressed() code block.\n\n```\nFunction ShowMessageDialog() As Void\n    port = CreateObject(\"roMessagePort\")\n    dialog = CreateObject(\"roMessageDialog\")\n    dialog.SetMessagePort(port)\n    dialog.SetTitle(\"[Message dialog title]\")\n    dialog.SetText(\"[Message dialog text............]\")\n\n    dialog.AddButton(1, \"[button text]\")\n    dialog.EnableBackButton(true)\n    dialog.Show()\n    While True\n        dlgMsg = wait(0, dialog.GetMessagePort())\n        If type(dlgMsg) = \"roMessageDialogEvent\"\n            if dlgMsg.isButtonPressed()\n                if dlgMsg.GetIndex() = 1\n                    exit while\n                end if\n            else if dlgMsg.isScreenClosed()\n                exit while\n            end if\n        end if\n    end while\nEnd Function\n```\n\n**Image: roMessageDialog example results**\n\n![roMessageDialog example results](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/roMessageDialogimage2.png \"roMessageDialogimage2\")",

If Roku discovers or determines that you are using the roMicrophone API and features in connection with content or channels directed toward children or with users known to be children, Roku reserves the right to disable or otherwise limit your access to the roMicrophone API feature and related functionality.\n\nYOU MAY NOT ENABLE THE roMicrophone API FEATURES IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ABOVE. PLEASE CONTACT ROKU FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. Implementation\n\nThe application should display a focusable button or indicator in the UI that the user selects by pressing and holding the OK button. In response to the OK press event, the application can call:\n\n*   [StartRecording()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifmicrophone.md\"StartRecording\") - to receive streamed audio data from the microphone asynchronously or\n*   [RecordToFile()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifmicrophone.md\"RecordToFile()\") - to have the audio data directly captured to a WAV format output file.\n\n> Roku OS will display a HUD to let the user initially consent to be recorded and to subsequently be informed when the microphone is being used. Recording is performed as long as the user holds down the OK button, or until a limit is reached or if an error should occur."

It also provides an optional \"filter banner\" for displaying categories representing filtered subsets of the data or categorized groups.\n\nEach item in the poster screen is represented by an image (aka poster), so any type of item that can be visually represented by an image can be displayed in the poster screen. It is used to show lists of data to users and common patterns include content categories, movies, podcasts, and search results.\n\nJust below the overhang is the filter banner. It allows a method of easily selecting or filtering content based on categories. The categories are set by the developer during screen initialization, and the script is notified when a new category is highlighted or selected. Based on the event notification, the script can set the desired content in the view. The filter banner is optional.\n\n**Diagram: roPosterScreen (flat-category)**\n\n![Diagram: roPosterScreen (flat-category)](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/roPosterScreenImage1.png \"roPosterScreenImage1\")\n\nShortDescriptionLine1 from the content metadata.

Registry data is removed only when the application explicitly removes it, the user uninstalls the application, which remove the registry for the application, or the user performs a factory reset, which removes the registry for all applications.\n\nAccess to the registry is available through the roRegistry object. This object is created with no parameters:\n\n`CreateObject(\"roRegistry\")`\n\nThere is a separate registry for each [developer ID](/docs/developer-program/publishing/packaging-channels.md#step-3-run-the-genkey-utility-to-create-a-signing-key \"developer ID\"). This allows multiple applications to use the registry without being able to read or modify the registry from other applications. If desired, a single registry can be shared across multiple applications by using the same developer ID to package the applications. This is the conventional way that an \"application suite\" with shared preferences and other shared information should work. Each registry is divided into sections which are specified by the developer for organization and grouping of attributes. Methods in ifRegistry are provided to list the sections in the registry and to provide access to the data in each section.\n\n> The maximum size of each zlib-compressed application registry is **16K bytes**. Channels should minimize the amount of data stored in the registry and the frequency in which they update it.\n> \n> Use the **ifRegistry.GetSpaceAvailable()** function to check the number of bytes available in the registry.\n\nThe Registry also supports the use of a special transient registry section. A registry section named \"Transient\" can be used to store attributes that have the lifetime of a single boot. Within a specific boot session, these values will be persistent to the application and stored as any other registry value. Whenever the user reboots the Roku Streaming Player, all \"Transient\" registry sections are removed and the values no longer persist. This technique is useful for caching data to minimize network access, yet still ensuring that this data is always fresh after a system reboot.\n\nThe registry is encrypted, and updates are relatively performance intensive and should be used sparingly. Note that all writes to the registry are delayed, and not committed to non-volatile storage until ifRegistry.Flush() or ifRegistrySection.Flush() is explicitly called. The platform may choose opportune times to flush data on its own, but no application is technically correct unless it explicitly calls Flush() at appropriate times. Flushing the registry is a relatively time-consuming operation, so it should be done as infrequently as possible. The Registry data is stored in a fault tolerant manner by preserving a backup for each write which is automatically rolled-back in the event of a failure."

            "description": "The roScreen component provides a full screen drawing surface that can be stacked and that you can receive input events from.\n\nYou will need at least one roScreen component in your 2D game application to draw on and get events from. The origin (0,0) is the top left corner of the screen. The pixels are always RGBA 32 bits. Multiple roScreen components stack, and like other screen components only the top screen is viewable and gets events. An roScreen that is not the top most screen can still be drawn to.\n\n> Once an roScreen is created, the display stack enters \"Game Mode\", and other screen components cannot be used. Screensavers will also be disabled and will appear as a black screen in its place. Other screen components cannot be intermixed with roScreens as the roScreen display stack is maintained independently from the main screen component display stack. When the final roScreen component is closed, other screen components can be used again.\n\nWhen the roScreen constructor is called, an optional double buffer flag, and an optional resolution can be passed. If the screen is double buffered, two buffers are fully allocated when CreateObject() succeeds. If the screen is single buffered only one buffer is allocated and the \"front\" and \"back\" buffers in method descriptions below are the same buffer. When a screen is created with a different resolution than the output display, it is scaled automatically to the output display resolution.\n\nTo maintain proper aspect ratio, and take care of the different pixel aspect ratio in HD vs SD; there is a fixed set of bitmap resolutions that are allowed to be created for screens:\n\n**HD mode screensizes**\n\n*   1280x720PAR=1:1 (default for HD)\n*   854x480 PAR=1:1 useful for higher performance HD games, also for 640x480 games\n*   940x480 PAR=1.1:1 used for displaying a RokuSD (720x480) games\n\n**SD mode screensizes**\n\n*   720x480 PAR=1.1:1 (default for SD)\n*   640x480 PAR=1:1 (used for 640x480 games)\n*   854x626 PAR=1:1 (used for 854x480 HD games)\n\nThe screen dimensions correspond to the drawable area that applications see. The dimensions were chosen so that applications do not need to compensate for screen aspect ratio or pixel aspect ratio.\n\nIt's likely that when porting games from other platforms, the active game area may be smaller and correspond to more traditional dimensions. In this case, the application can supply letterbox or pillarbox artwork and use an [roRegion](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/components/roregion.md\"roRegion\") to define the active area. The roRegion will translate and clip graphics to the proper area for the game. Similarly, roRegions are used to describe the left and right pillars for an SD game in HD mode, or the upper and lower letterbox regions for an HD game in SD mode.\n\nGames that require more performance should use smaller dimensions. Games should run in HD and SD mode. The screensizes HD 854x480 paired with SD 854x626 and HD 940x480 paired with SD 720x480 were designed for this purpose.\n\nThe game creates a single active game roRegion to do all graphics operations in. roRegions for pillar or letter boxes are used to fill the rest of the screen area depending on if the app is in HD or SD mode. Please refer to the dfSetupDisplayRegions() function in [v30/bslDefender.brs](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/language/component-architecture.mdv30bslcorebrs \"v30/bslDefender.brs\") for help in setting up the drawable regions in screen scaling.\n\nThere are some useful rules of thumb to be aware of to get the best performance when rendering your games:\n\n*   Alpha enabled regions are expensive to render\n\nIt is a requirement that the destination be alpha enabled in order for non-rectangular sprites to be properly rendered with transparency. However the sprite used for a background would typically have all pixels be fully nontransparent. Since alpha blending is expensive, a quick way to blit the background in this scenario is to first disable alpha on the screen, manually draw the background, and then enable alpha for the screen before drawing the rest of the sprites.\n\n*   Use smaller resolution images wherever possible. Scaling a large image down at run time is expensive with no benefit to the user\n*   Rendering text with DrawText() is expensive\n\nFortunately, many of these calls are redundant and can be eliminated. The static text for a particular level can be drawn on the background once and this newly created background can be used for refreshing the screen. This will eliminate almost all text redraws.\n\nA screen can be created with one of three constructors. If it is created with no parameters, the screen will be single buffered, and its output resolution will match the current display resolution (if the current resolution is specified in the manifest file ui\\_resolutions entry, otherwise the size will be 720p).\n\n`CreateObject(\"roScreen\")`\n\nIf a single parameter is passed, it is a Boolean that indicates if the screen is double buffered or not. See SwapBuffers():\n\n`CreateObject(\"roScreen\", true) ' double buffered screen`\n\nIf four parameters are passed, the last two specify the screen's resolution. The dimensions must be one of the screen sizes specified above:\n\n`CreateObject(\"roScreen\", true, 720, 480) ' db & SD res`\n\n**Example: Display an image**\n\n```\nScreen=CreateObject(\"roScreen\")\ndfDrawImage(screen, \"myphoto.jpg\",0,0)\nScreen.Finish()\n```\n\n**Example: Alpha blending**\n\n```\nwhite=&hFFFFFFFF\nscreen0=CreateObject(\"roScreen\")\nscreen0.SetAlphaEnable(true)\nscreen0.Clear(white)\nscreen0.DrawRect(100,100, screen0.GetWidth()-200, screen0.GetHeight()-200, &h80)\n' &h80 is black with a 50% alpha mix (RGBA)\nscreen0.finish()\n```"

The script is notified as each key is pressed so that a progress disclosure search can be performed if supported by the back-end service. In addition, the script can control the text displayed on the screen and will receive events when the text entry is complete.\n\nIn addition to entering search strings, this screen features a list that can be used to display search results or show the most recent searches. It's desirable for the screen to maintain a list of recent searches for the user to allow them to easily repeat a recent query without typing. In some implementations, it may be desirable to use this list to show a progressive set of results after each character while the user is typing.\n\nThis object is created with no parameters:\n\n`CreateObject(\"roSearchScreen\")`\n\n**Example**\n\n```\nREM ******************************************************\nREM Main routine - example of search screen usage\nREM ******************************************************\nSub Main()\n    print \"start\"\n    'toggle the search suggestions vs. search history behavior\n    'this allow you to generate both versions of the example below\n    displayHistory = false\n    history = CreateObject(\"roArray\", 1, true)\n    'prepopulate the search history with sample results\n    history.Push(\"seinfeld\")\n    history.Push(\"fraiser\")\n    history.Push(\"cheers\")\n    port = CreateObject(\"roMessagePort\")\n    screen = CreateObject(\"roSearchScreen\")\n    'commenting out SetBreadcrumbText() hides breadcrumb on screen\n    screen.SetBreadcrumbText(\"\", \"search\")\n    screen.SetMessagePort(port)\n    if displayHistory\n        screen.SetSearchTermHeaderText(\"Recent Searches:\")\n        screen.SetSearchButtonText(\"search\")\n        screen.SetClearButtonText(\"clear history\")\n        screen.SetClearButtonEnabled(true) 'defaults to true\n        screen.SetSearchTerms(history)\n    else\n        screen.SetSearchTermHeaderText(\"Suggestions:\")\n        screen.SetSearchButtonText(\"search\")\n        screen.SetClearButtonEnabled(false)\n    endif\n    print \"Doing show screen...\"\n    screen.Show()\n    print \"Waiting for a message from the screen...\"\n    ' search screen main event loop\n    done = false\n    while done = false\n        msg = wait(0, screen.GetMessagePort())\n        if type(msg) = \"roSearchScreenEvent\"\n            if msg.isScreenClosed()\n                print \"screen closed\"\n                done = true\n            else if msg.isCleared()\n                print \"search terms cleared\"\n                history.Clear()\n            else if msg.isPartialResult()\n                print \"partial search: \"; msg.GetMessage()\n                if not displayHistory\n                    screen.SetSearchTerms(GenerateSearchSuggestions(msg.GetMessage()))\n                endif\n            else if msg.isFullResult()\n                print \"full search: \"; msg.GetMessage()\n                history.Push(msg.GetMessage())\n                if displayHistory\n                    screen.AddSearchTerm(msg.GetMessage())\n                end if\n                'uncomment to exit the screen after a full search result:\n                'done = true\n            else\n                print \"Unknown event: \"; msg.GetType(); \" msg: \"; msg.GetMessage()\n            endif\n        endif\n    endwhile\n    print \"Exiting...\"\nEnd Sub\n\nFunction GenerateSearchSuggestions(partSearchText As String) As Object\n    availableContent = [\n        \"ghost in the shell\"\n        \"parasite dolls\"\n        \"final fantasy\"\n        \"ninja scroll\"\n        \"space ghost\"\n        \"hellboy\"\n        \"star wars\"\n        \"terminator\"\n        \"house of cards\"\n        \"dexter\"\n        ]\n    suggestions = []\n    if partSearchText <> \"\"\n        partSearchText = LCase(partSearchText)\n        for each available in availableContent\n            if available.Instr(partSearchText) >= 0\n                suggestions.Push(available)\n            end if\n        end for\n    end if\n    return suggestions\nEnd Function\n```\n\n**Image: roSearchScreen example results (search suggestions)**\n\n![Image: roSearchScreen example results (search suggestions)](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/roSearchScreen.png \"roSearchScreen\")",

This must be called before making a request. The developer can also use the Roku standard cert bundle (which contains certificates for most common signing authorities) stored in common:/certs/ca-bundle.crt; or download the CA certificate [here](https://github.com/rokudev/ca-certificate/blob/master/ca-bundle.crt).\n\nThe web server can authenticate that the requested connection is from a Roku Streaming Player and that the request is from your application by taking the following actions:\n\n*   Add the Roku CA certificate to the web server's certificate authorities keychain, download the CA certificate.\n*   Configure your web server to reject any connection that does not have a valid client certificate.\n*   Check the X-Roku-Reserved-Dev-Id header in the request. It should contain the Developer ID of your application. If it does not, another application on the Roku is attempting to access the server, and the request is rejected.\n\n**Example**\n\nIn order for your web server to perform the steps above to authenticate your Roku Streaming Player, your application needs to call the following functions before performing any https requests:\n\n```\nobject.SetCertificatesFile(\"common:/certs/ca-bundle.crt\")\nobject.AddHeader(\"X-Roku-Reserved-Dev-Id\", \"\")\nobject.InitClientCertificates()\n```"

The developer is responsible for initial playback setup and providing the required data (e.g. StreamURLs, SteamsBitrates, etc.) as part of the [Content Meta-Data](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/content-metadata.md \"Content Meta-Data\"). Once created and displayed, the screen will respond to events and manage the playback experience for the user.\n\nThe roVideoScreen is designed for streaming content. The preferred implementation should provide multiple bitrates (ideally four) of video to provide a high quality user experience under a variety of network conditions. Using the StreamBitrates and StreamURLs provided in the content meta-data for the item, the roVideoScreen will automatically monitor and select the best stream based on the users measured bandwidth. If network performance changes, the system will adapt and rebuffer to stream at a different bandwidth if necessary. Note that the StreamURLs, StreamBitrates, StreamQualities and StreamStickyHttpRedirects are all arrays that are aligned with each other. For example, the first stream listed would be the 0th element of all of these arrays.\n\nThe bitrates should represent the actual bitrate of the stream. The bitrate is used for both the display of the dots as well as the stream selection algorithm. The dots work a follows; If the stream bitrate equals:\n\n*   0 = no dots\n*   < 500 Kbps= 1 dot\n*   < 800 Kbps = 2 dots\n*   <1.1 Mbps = 3 dots\n*   > \\= 1.1 Mbps = 4 dots\n    \n\nThe dots are displayed automatically based on the bitrate of the stream selected unless there is a single stream and the bitrate is set to zero, then it won't show any dots. The StreamQuality attribute is used to select streams and indicates if a stream is HD or not. If the attribute for HDBranded is set to true and the stream is HD, the HD icon will show beside the quality dots. If the StreamQuality is set to HD, and the user display type is set to SD, the HD stream will not be selected.\n\nThe roVideoScreen automatically provides trick mode for all supported content types. There are two type of trick modes supported; scene based selection and time-based selection. If BIF image files are provided for a title, scene-based trick modes will appear. (See the BIF File format Documentation for more information) The user will be presented with the images and progress bar needed for SEEK, FF, REW within a stream. The following image shows how trick modes are rendered with BIF files:\n\n![IMAGE](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/worddavdc8a50b63d70082736fbebee19c18eff.png \"worddavdc8a50b63d70082736fbebee19c18eff\")\n\nThe FF/REW functionality provides three speeds; slow, medium and fast. At slower speeds, the system displays the current frame in the center of the screen and additional frames on the side for contextual information. At higher speeds, the side frames disappear and only the center image is displayed. The I-frames within the video do not need to precisely align with the time stamp of the image frames in the BIF file. When the user stops and selects a frame, the video playback begins at the first I-frame less than or equal to the time position of the selected frame.\n\nWhen BIF images are not available, the system will default to a time based trick play behavior. The user control is still the same, but only the progress bar is displayed and the user will not see individual scenes within the video. This mode is the default, so if images are not available for an individual title, the system will always provide this functionality by default.\n\nThe system will only seek to locations on an I-Frame boundary. Window Media (WMA9 or VC-1) uses the simple index object to determine the I-frame locations and H.264 uses the MOOV atom to determine the correct offsets. If the BIF images are at a consistent time intervals which do not align to I-Frame boundaries, the system will use the nearest I-Frame less than or equal to the time of the BIF image. MP4 or Windows Media are the preferred formats.\n\n**Important Notes on Video Playback**\n\n*   The dimensions vary on a title-by-title basis depending on the source material and the target aspect ratio for the encode (e.g. 4:3 or 16:9). Content is always encoded at full width and the height is adjusted. For example, a 1.66 aspect ratio source is encoded as a 720x432 video and displayed as letterboxed for a 4:3 display.\n    \n*   The frame rate used for encoding is dependent on the source material. Film content is generally 23.976 fps, while video content is generally at 29.97.\n    \n*   For typical streaming video applications, we recommend a range of 384Kbps to 4.5Mbps. For USB playback, we recommend that you stay under 8.0 Mbps. This provides a good balance between quality and support for a wide number of users. In some cases lower and higher bitrates have been used, but this frequently results in poor quality or limits the % of the installed base that can view this encoding.\n    \n*   It is critical that the StreamURLs, StreamBitrates, StreamQualities and StreamStickyHttpRedirects arrays are all aligned with each other. For example, the first stream listed would be the 0th element of all of these arrays. You may have multiple streams in the arrays and the system will automatically pick the most appropriate stream based on the users available bandwidth and video settings.\n    \n*   The StreamQualities array identifies streams as either SD or HD. If the user is configured for SD the system will not select HD streams for playback.\n    \n*   The optional StreamStartTimeOffset is the offset into the stream which is considered to be the new origin of playback.\n    \n*   Live – declares the video as live and replaces the time remaining text in the progress bar with \"live\".\n    \n*   HLS Http Live Streaming support is included in the Roku OS (Introduced in Roku OS2.6). We currently support version 3 of the Http Live Streaming protocol (Pantos – Draft submitted to IETF November 19, 2010 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-05](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-05) ). When using HLS, the StreamUrls and StreamQualities array should each have exactly one element. If the HLS stream has only a single bitrate stream, the StreamBitrates array should contain one element specifying that bitrate. If the stream contains more than one variant stream at multiple bitrates, the StreamBitrates array should contain one element with a value of zero. Please see the Video Encoding Guide for information about creating HLS .m3u8 files and segmented .ts files from your current h264 encoded video or distributing live video over HLS to the Roku box.\n    \n*   In addition to the support for version 2 of the HLS Pantos draft spec, the Roku box supports .m3u8 files that are compressed via deflate or gzip.\n    \n    *   The HTTP response for a query that returns a gzip-compressed file must contain the header: Content-Encoding: gzip\n    *   The HTTP response for a query that returns a deflate-compressed file must contain the header: Content-Encoding: deflate\n*   \"Trick Modes\" and seeking work a little differently with HLS streams. There are a couple of ways that seeking works with HLS and they are different than other streams.\n    \n    One way of seeking uses the \"target duration\" specified in the .m3u8 file. The first segment in an m3u8 file is assigned a time offset:\n    \n    T = G \\* N\n    \n    where G is the \"target duration\" value and N is the sequence number of the segment. Each subsequent segment is assigned a time offset equal to T (the time offset of the first segment) plus the duration value of all earlier segments. The duration of a segment is determined by the EXTINF line before that segment.\n    \n*   Smooth Streaming (since v4.7) and later by setting the StreamFormat to \"ism\" and setting the streamURL to the MANIFEST url.\n    \n    *   The player type (ContentMetaData.StreamFormat) is \"ism\"\n    *   The stream URL is the URL that points to the manifest\n    *   Only H.264 and/or AAC encoding formats are currently supported.\n    *   Only direct PlayReady licensing is supported. Indirect licensing is currently unsupported. That is, for decryption to work, the ProtectionHeader must be available in the manifest and the LA\\_URL should contain a valid URL to an accessible PlayReady license server.\n    *   If there are multiple audio tracks, a track will be chosen based on the StreamIndex.Language attribute in the manifest. If the StreamIndex.Language attribute is not populated, the audio track will be chosen arbitrarily. To select a specific audio track before playback, set the ContentMetaData.TrackIDAudio field to the desired track's StreamIndex.Name attribute.\n    *   If there are multiple video tracks, a track will be chosen arbitrarily. To select a specific video track before playback, set the ContentMetaData.TrackIDVideo field to the desired track's StreamIndex.Name attribute.\n*   Standard PlayReady SDK 2.0 Direct License Acquisition Over-the-Air (since v4.8) works by reading the Rights Management Protection Header in the Smooth Streaming Manifest Url. The Roku OS retrieves the license from the PlayReady license server at the license acquisition url endpoint in the Protection Header.\n    \n\n```\n#EXT-X_TARGETDURATION:10\n#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:37\n#EXTINF:10\nurl1\n#EXTINF:8\nurl2\n#EXTINF:10\nurl3\n```\n\nThe segment url1 has a time offset of 370, url2 is 380, and url3 is 388. Note that if no TARGETDURATION is specified, the default is 1, so the first segment in the file will have a nonzero time offset (equal to the target duration). The PlayStart content-meta data value allows direct seeking to an offset that is valid within the window of data in the current .m3u8 file.\n\nThere is a second way to seek in an HLS stream. If the m3u8 file has #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME entries, you can seek to a particular date/time by passing a value equal to a modified Unix epoch value. The modified epoch is 1/1/2004 rather than the standard Unix epoch of 1/1/1970. A Unix time value can be converted to an HLS seek time by subtracting 1072915200 (the number of seconds between 1/1/1970 and 1/1/2004). Once again, setting the PlayStart content meta data value allows direct seeking to a specific time offset.\n\nFor example, to seek to the segment marked with the date/time of 7/4/2010 11:30, set PlayStart to 205327800. An example shell expression showing this arithmetic is:\n\n```\n% expr `date -d \"7/4/2010Z11:30:00.000\" +%s` - 1072915200\n205327800\n```\n\nIn BrightScript, the same calculation might be:\n\n```\ndt = CreateObject(\"roDateTime\")\ndt.fromISO8601String(\"7/4/2010T11:30:00.000\")\nitemContentMetaData.PlayStart = dt. asSeconds() - 1072915200 '205327800\n```\n\n1.  In Roku OS version 2.6, we've introduced support for SRT files. Please see the content meta-data parameter SubtitleUrl for pointing to a matching SRT file for your video content.\n    \n2.  In Roku OS version 2.7, we've introduced 1080p support. Please see the content meta-data parameter FullHD for specifying 1080p resolution. Playback at 1080p resolution will only occur when the user has set the display type to HDTV 1080p. Another content meta-data parameter, FrameRate, specifies the frames per second of the video. Valid values are 24 and 30. If the user's display type is set to 1080p and FullHD for the content is false or not set, HD playback will be at 720p resolution. If the user's display type is set to HDTV 720p and FullHD content is set to 1080p resolution, the box will downscale the content to 720p resolution.\n    \n\n**Example**\n\n```\n'**********************************************************************\n' This example function is passed an associative array representing a ' piece of content (e.g. a TV episode) There are other attributes\n' (title, description, etc.) but this example focuses on showing\n' attributes required for initiating playback.

If they are called before an object is fully constructed, such as before all graphical images have been loaded, they will return the dimensions and location at the time of the call, which may not be the correct values for placing the component object properly. To ensure that your screen has the component objects located as you intended, make sure you call these methods after the component object is fully constructed. For example, if the component object relies on loading graphical images to construct its appearance, it is best to use these methods as part of an observer callback function triggered by the image loading field events, such as the loadStatus field of the Poster node."
