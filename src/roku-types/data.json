            "description": "Extends [**AnimationBase**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/abstract-nodes/animationbase.md\n\nThe Animation node class provides animations of renderable nodes, by applying interpolator functions to the values in specified renderable node fields. For an animation to take effect, an Animation node definition must include a child field interpolator node ([FloatFieldInterpolator](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/floatfieldinterpolator.md\"FloatFieldInterpolator\"), [Vector2DFieldInterpolator](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/vector2dfieldinterpolator.md\"Vector2DFieldInterpolator\"), [ColorFieldInterpolator](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/colorfieldinterpolator.md\"ColorFieldInterpolator\")) definition for each renderable node field that is animated.\n\nThe Animation node class provides a simple linear interpolator function, where the animation takes place smoothly and simply from beginning to end. The Animation node class also provides several more complex interpolator functions to allow custom animation effects. For example, you can move a graphic image around the screen at differing speeds and curved trajectories at different times in the animation by specifying the appropriate function in the easeFunction field (quadratic and exponential are two examples of functions that can be specified). The interpolator functions are divided into two parts: the beginning of the animation (ease-in), and the end of the animation (ease-out). You can apply a specified interpolator function to either or both ease-in and ease-out, or specify no function for either or both (which is the linear function). You can also change the portion of the animation that is ease-in and ease-out to arbitrary fractional values for a quadratic interpolator function applied to both ease-in and ease-out.",

            "description": "Extends [**Node**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/node.md\n\nThe ColorFieldInterpolator node class specifies a keyframe animation sequence to be applied to the color field of a node (such as the color field of a Label node).\n\nAll field interpolators include a set of key/keyValue field pairs that define a keyframe of the animation. Field interpolators are generally used as children of an Animation node. As the animation progresses, it sets the fraction field of its field interpolators to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the fraction of the animation progress. The keyframe fields of the interpolator are key, the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and keyValue, the value that the field should have at that fraction of the animation.\n\nFor example, if a ColorFieldInterpolator node had three keyframes:\n\n*   0.0, 0xFF0000FF (red)\n*   0.4, 0x00FF00FF (green)\n*   1.0, 0x0000FFFF (blue)\n\nWhen the interpolator fraction field value was 0.0 (that is, 0%), the color field value would be set to red. When the fraction field value was 0.4 (that is, 40%), the color field value would be set to green. When the fraction field value was 1.0 (that is, 100%), the color field value would be set to blue.\n\nFor values of the fraction field between 0.0 and 0.4 (such as 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValue field values for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to a color halfway between red and green. Similarly, when the fraction field value is between the second and third keys (that is, between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValue field values of the second and third keyframes.\n\nIf the first keyframe has a key field fraction value greater than zero, then the field value is equal to the keyValue field value of the first keyframe until the fraction field value reaches the first keyframe key field fraction value. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key field fraction value less than one, the color field value is set to the keyValue field value of the last keyframe, from when the fraction field value equals the last keyframe key field fraction value percentage, and will not change as the fraction field value increases from that value to 1.0.\n\nThe ColorFieldInterpolator node class works in the HSV color space. Doing the interpolation in the HSV color space produces the most intuitive, visually pleasing results when animating color values.\n\n> While linear interpolation is used to compute the keyValue field values for fraction field values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the fraction field values computed by the Animation node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.",

Many nodes and components require a ContentNode as the specification of their content field in order to be properly configured. In general, lists, grids, and panels require a ContentNode for configuration. The data included in a ContentNode can be data such as the text for labels in the node or component, and the spacing between items in a list, grid, or panel, including data to create custom lists, grids, and panels. The reference information for every node or component that requires a ContentNode includes a section that details the requirements of the ContentNode for that node or component.\n\nContentNodes defined as the specification for a node or component content field are typically structured as one ContentNode parent node, with a hierarchy of child nodes that specify the actual data, and sections of data if needed. For example, a [LabelList](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/list-and-grid-nodes/labellist.md\"LabelList\") node can have several sections that divide the entire list, each with their own section heading, and specific items in that section of the list. The ContentNode for that LabelList node should have two levels of child ContentNodes, one level for the data to configure the list sections, and then another level of child ContentNodes for the data for each item in that list section.\n\nA ContentNode can also be used to specify the data for custom components with defined interfaces, and for nodes and components that require [Content Meta-Data](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/content-metadata.md \" Content Meta-Data\"). Also, you should use a ContentNode for complex structures of data for your application rather than associative arrays. ContentNode objects are passed by reference in the application, while associative array objects are copied. For large complex data structures, passing ContentNode objects is much quicker than passing the equivalent associative array object.

Field interpolators are generally used as children of an Animation node. As the animation progresses, it sets the fraction field of its field interpolators to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the percentage of the Animation's progress. The keyframes of the interpolator include a \"key\", the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and a \"keyValue\", the value that the field should have at that percentage.\n\nFor example, if a FloatFieldInterpolator had three keyframes, (0.0, 10.0), (0.4, 200.0) and (1.0, 87.0), then when the interpolator's fraction field was 0.0 (i.e. 0%), the field would be set to 10.0. When fraction was 0.4 (i.e. 40%), the field would be set to 200.0. When fraction was 1.0 (i.e. 100%), the field would be set to 87.0.\n\nFor values of fraction between 0.0 and 0.4 (e.g. 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to 10.0 + 0.5 \\* (10.0 + 200.0) = 105.0. Similarly, when fraction is between the second and third keys (i.e. between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues of the second and third keyframes.\n\nIf the first keyframe has a key percentage greater than zero, then the field value will be equal to the keyValue of the first keyframe until fraction reaches the first keyframe's key percentage. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key percentage less than one, the field value will be set to the keyValue of the last keyframe from when fraction equals the the last keyframe's key percentage and will not change as fraction increases from that value to 1.0.\n\n> While linearly interpolation is used to compute the keyValue's for fraction values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the fraction values computed by the Animation node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.",

            "description": "> Roku OS 10.0 introduced a new [StandardKeyboardDialog node](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/standard-dialog-framework-nodes/standard-keyboard-dialog.md\"**Standard Keyboard Dialog**\"), which features updated graphics, color palette support, and voice entry support. This enables developers to provide a consistent user experience across the keyboard dialogs in their channel, and help speed up customer sign-ups and sign-ins. Developers must replace the legacy KeyboardDialog nodes in their channel with the new [StandardKeyboardDialog node](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/standard-dialog-framework-nodes/standard-keyboard-dialog.md\"**Standard Keyboard Dialog**\").\n> \n> To upgrade a legacy keyboard dialog to the standard version, prepend \"Standard\" to the node type. For example, change `keyboarddialog = createObject(\"roSGNode\", \"KeyboardDialog\")` to `keyboarddialog = createObject(\"roSGNode\", \"StandardKeyboardDialog\")`.\n\nExtends [**Dialog**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/dialog-nodes/dialog.md\"**Dialog**\")\n\nThe KeyboardDialog node class is a special type of Dialog node that prompts the user to enter an alphanumeric text string. The KeyboardDialog node class includes an interrnal Keyboard node to allow the user to enter the string.\n\nThe KeyboardDialog allows you to add a title (by setting the Dialog title field), a help message (by setting the Dialog message field), and a set of action buttons (by setting the Dialog node buttons field). The bulletText and graphicUrl fields of the Dialog node should not be set. If those Dialog node fields are set, the layout of the dialog will likely not look correct.\n\nAlso, the KeyboardDialog node class inherits the behavior of the interrnal [Keyboard](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/widget-nodes/keyboard.md\"Keyboard\") node when the Options remote key is pressed. The Keyboard node class toggles between uppercase and lowercase letters when the Options remote key is pressed, to speed the entry of mixed-case strings by the user. Therefore, the optionsDialog field of the Dialog node class should not be set to true.\n\nTypically, you will want to set the KeyboardDialog node title field to prompt the user to enter the string, and add \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons by setting the Dialog node buttons field to \\[ \"OK\", \"Cancel\" \\], then observe the Dialog node class buttonSelected field to react when the user presses one of those buttons. At any time, the text field can be accessed to obtain the string entered by the user.\n\nAnother typical usage of the KeyboardDialog node class adds a \"Hide Text\" button, with an observer function set up to toggle the secureMode field of the Keyboard node internal TextEditBox node (that is, by toggling the value of the keyboard.textEditBox.secureMode field).",

The contents of each grid item is an instance of an XML component specified by the `itemComponentName` field. An instance of the XML component is used to display the data for each item in the grid data model. The appearance of the grid item as it enters/exits the grid focus position can be customized using scripting. [SimpleMarkupList.zip](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/blob/master/ux%20components/lists%20and%20grids/SimpleMarkupList.zip) is a sample channel containing a MarkupGrid where each item is an instance of an XML component. See the section [MarkupGrid XML component](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/list-and-grid-nodes/markupgrid.mdmarkupgrid-xml-component) for details.\n\nThe number of columns in the MarkupGrid node is fixed and the number of rows varies as needed to display all of the items in the grid data model. The items in the grid fill each row from left to right, then top to bottom. For example, if the grid data contains 8 items and the number of columns is set to 3, then items 1, 2 and 3 will be in the first row. Items 4, 5 and 6 will be in the second row. The third row will contain items 7 and 8 in the leftmost two columns and blank space in the right column.\n\nThe layout of rows and columns in the grid is very flexible. Possible layouts include:\n\n*   a simple layout with all items in the grid having the same size\n*   a layout with the items in some rows having varying heights and/or the items in some columns having varying widths\n*   a layout with varying width rows and columns and items that occupy one or more rows and columns\n\nThe grid items can be organized into sections that are demarcated by labelled horizontal divider lines between the sections.",

            "description": "Extends [**Group**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/layout-group-nodes/group.md\"**Group**\")\n\nThe MaskGroup node class allows an alpha mask bitmap to be applied to the rendering of its children. This allows effects such as having a list fade out at the bottom to be easily created.\n\n> MaskGroup nodes do not work on all Roku players (specifically, MaskGroup nodes only work on players that support OpenGL). On players whose graphics do not support OpenGL, a MaskGroup node just renders its children without applying the extra alpha mask. For this reason, you should avoid using the MaskGroup node for anything other than decorative purposes, such as creating a fading effect at the bottom of the screen, where the user interface information value of the screen element is not affected by the lack of the MaskNode node rendering.\n\nUnlike other bitmaps, the MaskGroup node class does not work with 9-patch images. If the bitmap size does not match the group bounding rectangle, the edge rows of the mask are repeated as needed.\n\nFor example, suppose the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle has an origin at (0, 0), a width of 150 and a height of 80. If the mask bitmap were also 150 by 80, and the maskOffset and maskSize field values were left at their default values of \\[ 0, 0 \\], then each pixel of the mask bitmap would be applied to the corresponding pixel of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle. The figure below illustrates that case. On the right is a MaskGroup node that contains a Poster node. In the center is an alpha bitmap with the same size as the Poster node. On the right is the result of rendering the MaskGroup node with the image in the center used as a mask.\n\n![roku815px - maskExample1](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/maskExample1.png \"maskExample1\")\n\nThe maskSize and maskOffset field values can be used to scale and offset the mask bitmap relative to the group coordinate system, as shown in the figure below. The mask is the same bitmap as in the figure above. In the below figure, the maskOffset field value has been set to (50, 30), offsetting the origin of the mask bitmap coordinate system relative to the origin of the MaskGroup node coordinate system 50 pixels to the left and 30 pixels down.The maskSize field value has been set to (100, 50), This causes the width of the mask bitmap to be scaled from 150 to 100, and the height of the mask bitmap to be scaled from 80 to 50, so that the mask right edge aligns with the right edge of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle, and the mask bottom edge aligns with the bottom edge of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle. The center of the figure shows the mask with the maskOffset and maskSize field values applied overlaid on top of the MaskGroup node. The right side of the figure shows the result of applying the mask to the MaskGroup node. Notice that the left column of pixels in the mask is used as the mask for all columns of the MaskGroup node that lie to the left of the mask, causing those columns to be rendered with full opacity. Similarly, and the top row of the mask is used as the mask for all rows of the MaskGroup node that lie above the mask, causing each of the rows to fade out on the right.\n\n![roku815px - maskExample2](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/maskExample2.png \"maskExample2\")\n\nAs shown in above, the transformed mask may not overlay all the rendered pixels of the MaskGroup node. In that case, the leftmost (rightmost) columns of the mask bitmap are used as the mask for any MaskGroup node pixels that are to the left (right) of the transformed mask. The top (bottom) row of the mask bitmap is used as the mask for MaskGroup node pixels that are above (below) the transformed mask.",

The PanelSet node manages the position of a set of child Panel nodes, and implements the left and right panel sliding behavior. Once a Panel node has been added to a PanelSet node, it remains a child of the PanelSet node unless it is replaced by another Panel node, or slides completely off the right side of the screen.\n\nThe PanelSet node is designed to display two Panel nodes in most cases, one Panel node on the left and one on the right. When the PanelSet node has focus, and the user presses the **Left** (or **Back**) or **Right** remote control key, the panels slide to the left or right one position.\n\nFor example, suppose the PanelSet node has two Panel nodes as children, panel A and panel B. When the user presses the **Right** key, a new panel, panel C, should be created and added as a child of the PanelSet node. Adding a panel as a child of the PanelSet node causes all the panels to slide left one position, so that panel A is now offscreen to the left, panel B is in the left position, and panel C is in the right position. If the user presses the **Right** key again, a new panel, panel D, should be created and added as a child node of the PanelSet node. Adding panel D causes the panels to slide left again so that panels A and B are offscreen to the left, panel C is in the left position, and panel D is in the right position.\n\nAt this point, if the user presses the **Left** key (or **Back** key), the panels will slide one position to the _right_, _back_ towards the original home position, so panel D will slide offscreen to the right, panel C will slide to the right position, and panel B will slide to the left position (panel A is still offscreen to the left). When the sliding animation ends, since panel D is offscreen to the right, it is automatically removed as a child node of the PanelSet node.",

This enables developers to provide a consistent user experience across the PIN pad dialogs in their channel, and help speed up customer sign-ups and sign-ins. Developers must replace the legacy PinDialog nodes in their channel with the new [StandardPinPadDialog node](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/standard-dialog-framework-nodes/standard-pinpad-dialog.md\"**Standard PinPad Dialog**\").\n> \n> To upgrade a legacy pinpad dialog to the standard version, prepend \"Standard\" to the node type. For example, change `pindialog = createObject(\"roSGNode\", \"PinDialog\")` to `pindialog = createObject(\"roSGNode\", \"StandardPinDialog\")`.\n\nExtends [**Dialog**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/dialog-nodes/dialog.md\"**Dialog**\")\n\nThe PinDialog node class is a special type of Dialog node that prompts the user to enter a numeric string.

The bulletText and graphicUrl fields of the Dialog node should not be set. If those fields are set, the layout of the PinDialog node will likely not look correct.\n\nTypically, you will want to set the Dialog node title field to prompt the user to enter a PIN, and add \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons by setting the Dialog node buttons field to \\[ \"OK\", \"Cancel\" \\], then observe the Dialog node buttonSelected field to react when the user presses one of those buttons. At any time, the PinDialog node pin field can be accessed to obtain the PIN value entered by the user.\n\nThe PinDialog node displays a privacy hint at the bottom of the dialog instructing the user how to show/hide the PinPad node focus indicator with the Options remote key. This provides more privacy for the user when entering a PIN. You should not override this default behavior of the Options remote key in the PinDialog node.",

Because the Poster node class extends the Group node class, a Poster node can have child nodes. For example, a Poster node might have a Label node as a child that draws an annotation on top of the poster.\n\nThe Poster node class supports JPEG, PNG and (since Roku OS 9.4) [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) image files. Please observe [Special WebP considerations](/docs/specs/media/streaming-specifications.md#special-webp-considerations) when using the latter.\n\nThe Poster node class includes the capability to automatically scale graphical images to different sizes as they are loaded, by setting the loadWidth and loadHeight field values. After the graphical images are loaded, the images can be scaled to fit within the target screen element area specified by the width and height field values. To use this capability, select the scaling option you want as the value of the loadDisplayMode field.\n\nSee SceneGraph's [Texture Memory](/docs/developer-program/performance-guide/memory-management.md#texture-memory \"Texture Memory\") feature for more information.\n\n> In order for the load scaling options to work, the option fields must be set in XML markup before the uri field",

This enables developers to provide a consistent user experience across the progress dialogs in their channel. Developers should replace the legacy ProgressDialog nodes in their channel with the new [StandardProgressDialog nodes](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/standard-dialog-framework-nodes/standard-progress-dialog.md22 \"**Standard Progress Dialog**\").\n> \n> To upgrade a legacy progress dialog to the standard version, prepend \"Standard\" to the node type. For example, change `progressdialog = createObject(\"roSGNode\", \"ProgressDialog\")` to `progressdialog = createObject(\"roSGNode\", \"StandardProgressDialog\")`.\n\nExtends [**Dialog**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/dialog-nodes/dialog.md\"**Dialog**\")\n\nThe ProgressDialog node class is a special type of Dialog node that includes the dialog title region and a spinning icon as the body of the dialog. The ProgressDialog node class uses a BusySpinner node to display the spinning icon.\n\nThe message, bulleted text, graphic, and button regions of the dialog should all be empty. If those dialog regions are not empty, the layout of the dialog will likely not look correct.\n\n> Not all Roku Player hardware supports arbitrary rotations. In particular, some hardware only supports 90 degree rotation increments. In those cases, the icon will step through 90 degree, 180 degree, 270 degree and back to 0 degree rotations, rather than spin smoothly.",

The specific palette values used by those nodes are defined in each node's documentation.\n\nIf a node that supports a palette does not set its **palette** filed, the RSGPalette is inherited from ancestor nodes in the scene graph. Specifically, the node looks up the scene graph until it finds a **PaletteGroup** node with its **palette** field set. This may be found in the **Scene** itself.\n\nIf no node in the scene graph has its **palette** field set, the keyboard uses the default palette (gray background/white text).\n\nCurrently, the **RSGPalette** node is typically used in channels that customize the colors of the dynamic keyboard nodes. In this case, the channel assigns the RSGPalette node to the **palette** field of the [DynamicKeyboardBase](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/dynamic-voice-keyboard-nodes/dynamic-keyboard-base.md\"DynamicKeyboardBase\") node and lets the keyboard's **DynamicKeyGrid** and **VoiceTextEditBox** inherit that RSGPalette.\n\n> The colors in the RSGPalette do not cascade.

            "description": "Extends [**Group**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/layout-group-nodes/group.md\"**Group**\")\n\nThe TargetGroup node class associates a set of rectangular regions that children of the group will occupy. Like MarkupList, the TargetGroup has a content field containing the data for each item and an itemComponentName field that specifies an RSG component that will be used to render a content item. It also has a targetSet field that contains a [TargetSet](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/list-and-grid-nodes/targetset.md\"TargetSet\") that define a set of rectangular targets where children of the TargetGroup will be rendered.\n\nThe TargetGroup node is typically used to create a scrolling list (or row) of items where the focused item occupies more space than the other items.\n\nFor example, a TargetGroup could be used to create a full screen vertical scrolling list of item where the focused item is larger than the other items in the list. As the list items scroll, the appearance of the item moving into the focus region would be dynamically adjusted to fill the larger focus region. Simultaneously, the appearance of the item leaving the focus region would be dynamically adjust to return to the unfocused size. To set up this use case, you might set the targetSet field to a TargetSet node that specifies nine rectangles. The first rectangle would be specified to have the width and height of an unfocused item and be positioned so that it's bottom is above the top of the screen. The last rectangle would be specified to have the width and height of an unfocused item and be positioned so that's top is below the bottom of the screen. The remaining seven rectangles would define the rectangular regions of the onscreen items. Suppose the design calls for the focus item to be centered vertically at the center of the screen. To do that, you would specify the 5th rectangle to be larger than the other eight and position it so that it is centered vertically, you would specify the remaining rectangles to form a column of rectangular regions where the top three and bottom three visible items would be located.\n\nThe second step of setting up this use case would be to implement an RSG component that will be used to render each item. The TargetGroup node manages the creation of the items for the visible components, associates each with a ContentNode, and updates fields of the item component with information such as the current width and height of the item and the focus status of the item.\n\nThe TargetGroup's jumpToItem field is set to identify which content item is to be located at the TargetSet's targetRects field target rectangle identified by the TargetSet's focusindex field.\n\nThe final step of setting up this use case would be to create a VerticalList component that extends TargetGroup, sets up the TargetGroup's TargetSet node, and as the user presses up and down buttons on the remote, sets the TargetGroup's animateToTargetItem field to the prior or next index. Setting the animateToTargetItem field causes the displayed items to smoothly animate from their current target region to another target region, such that the specified index ends up at the TargetSet's target rectangle that is identified by the TargetSet's focusIndex field.\n\nThe above use case specifies the most common use case for the TargetGroup node, but only hints at the possible uses. For example, you could create your own RSG components with various custom behaviors. There might include:\n\n*   A list where all the items are small when the list does not have the focus, but when the list receives the focus, all of the items smoothly adjust their size and position so that the focus item is largest, the items on either side of the focus item are slightly larger than the unfocused size and the remaining items remain the same size as the unfocused items. To do this, you would create two TargetSet's in your RSG component, one that defines the regions when the list is unfocused and one that defines the regions when the list is focused. Initially, the TargetGroup's targetSet field would be set to the unfocused TargetSet node. Then, when the list is focused, the targetSet's animateToTargetSet field would be set to the focused TargetSet node, causing all of the target regions to smoothly animate to their new size and position, taking along the associated item component's with them.\n*   A horizontal scrolling list of items where the focused region floats across the screen as the user presses left/right until the focus region reaches the edge of the display, at which point the focus region remains stationary and the items scroll left or right. This would require the use of several TargetSet nodes (one for each possible position of the focus region). Initally, the TargetGroup's targetSet field would be set to one of these TargetSet's. Then while the focus region is not at one of the edges, key presses would set the animateToTargetSet field to animate the focus region to its next location. Once the focus region reaches an edge, another key press in the same direction would set the animateToTargetIndex field to cause the items to scroll so that the next content item occupies the focus region.\n*   A list where when an item is selected, all of the items fly off the screen while the selected item zooms up and moves to the center of the screen. To set up this use case, you would specify a TargetSet for when the list items are onscreen and another TargetSet for the onscreen location of the focused item and the offscreen locations where each items will disappear.\n*   A circular arrangement of a fixed number of items with the item at the 6 o'clock position being larger and having the focus. Note that in this case, no offscreen targets would be specified.",

            "description": "Extends [**Node**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/node.md\n\nThe Task node class allows you to specify a function to be spawned in a different thread, and run asynchronously with respect to both the scene rendering thread and the main application thread. A Task node also allows you to run functions that cannot be run in SceneGraph node or component, typically BrightScript code functions involving operations such as reading data from servers and file system manipulation. (You also cannot, and should not, run functions in a SceneGraph application for operations that are functionally the same as SceneGraph nodes and components, such as playing videos.) A list of all the BrightScript functions and components that cannot be used in SceneGraph applications or can only be used in a Task node can be found in [BrightScript Support](/docs/developer-program/core-concepts/scenegraph-brightscript/brightscript-support.md \"BrightScript Support\").\n\nA Task node is typically used to read data from a server to create a ContentNode to configure a SceneGraph node or component (see [ContentNode](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/control-nodes/contentnode.md\"ContentNode\")). A Task node used for this purpose can be thought of as a content reader. Since ContentNodes are required to configure many components rendered in a scene, such as lists, panels, and grids, and you will generally want to read the data for those types of nodes from your server, you should create a Task node as a content reader for each of those components that you use in your scene.\n\nThe Task node class was designed with three general development use cases:\n\n*   A new Task node object is created for each asynchronous operation. The input data needed for the operation is set in the Task node object [<interface>](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/xml-elements/interface.md\"<interface>\") fields in the render thread, along with an observer of the output field data, and the Task node control field is set to RUN. After the output data is returned to the render thread, the Task node object is not used again.\n*   A Task node object is used multiple times for several identical asynchronous operations. In this case, the input data for each operation is set in the existing Task node object, with another observer for the output field data, and the Task node control field is again set to RUN. This may be more efficient than creating a new Task node object for each of the identical operations.\n*   A Task node observes its input fields using the port form of the ifSGNodeField [observeField()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifsgnodefield.mdobservefieldfieldname-as-string-functionname-as-string-as-boolean \"observeField()\") method, and returns output data with each field change. In this case, the Task node acts like a continuous server.\n\nSince Task nodes launch asynchronous threads, and have no provisions for locks and mutexes, you must be careful to avoid race, deadlock, and other asynchronous thread errors. Here are a few tips for using Task nodes:\n\n*   Avoid accessing files which must be persistent before thread completion, to avoid a subsequent Task node or other thread access of the same file before the thread completes. It is easier and safer to use a dynamically-created string or other data object to hold temporary thread data to avoid having a subsequent or existing thread overwrite and corrupt the data.\n*   Be very careful if you access any object in a Task node that may exist in another thread. It is better to completely separate all objects in any other possible thread from the Task node thread by setting the fields of the Task node with copies of the minimum amount of data needed to run the thread.\n*   In the Task node init() function, perform the minimum required amount of initialization of the Task node and any included thread functions. If you intend to trigger an asynchronous task based on a Task node input field change, in many cases, you should only set up the observer for the field in init().\n*   Use the port form of the ifSGNodeField [observeField()](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifsgnodefield.mdobservefieldfieldname-as-string-functionname-as-string-as-boolean \"observeField()\") rather than the onChange attribute. This will avoid triggering the thread in response to a render thread event before the Task node observers are set up.\n*   It is more efficient to use a persistent Task node that is triggered by an \\\\\\\\ field change than to create a new Task node every time a particular asynchronous thread is required. If needed, you can communicate that the particular asynchronous thread is no longer required through an field as well, either through the triggering field, or a special field used for control of the Task node.\n*   You can use a single Task node object to run any number of different asynchronous threads by setting the functionName field to the Task node function you want before setting the control field to RUN. If you do not use the input data fields to trigger running the thread, this is equivalent to calling an asynchronous function, and passing the input data fields as arguments to the function. The output data fields can likewise be considered as the return value of a asynchronous function call, but to avoid blocking you must observe the fields, or the state field, as a callback event to handle the results in the calling thread.\n\nAlso review \"[SceneGraph threads](/docs/developer-program/core-concepts/threads.md \"SceneGraph\")\" for in-depth information on using Task nodes most efficiently.",

            "description": "Extends [**Node**](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/node.md\n\nVector2DFieldInterpolator specifies a keyframe animation sequence to be applied to a pair Vector2D field of a node. Most typically, this is used to animate the (x,y) coordinates of a node's translation field.\n\nAll field interpolators include a set of key/keyValue pairs that define a keyframe of the animation. Field interpolators are generally used as children of an Animation node. As the animation progresses, it sets the fraction field of its field interpolators to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the percentage of the Animation's progress. The keyframes of the interpolator include a \"key\", the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and a \"keyValue\", the value that the field should have at that percentage.\n\nFor example, if a Vector2DFieldInterpolator had three keyframes, (0.0, \\[0.0, 0.0\\]), (0.4, \\[500.0, 0.0\\]) and (1.0, \\[500, 200.0\\]), then when the interpolator's fraction field was 0.0 (i.e. 0%), the field would be set to \\[0.0, 0.0\\]. When fraction was 0.4 (i.e. 40%), the field would be set to \\[500.0, 0.0\\]. When fraction was 1.0 (i.e. 100%), the field would be set to \\[500.0, 200.0\\].\n\nFor values of fraction between 0.0 and 0.4 (e.g. 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to \\[250.0, 0.0\\] (halfway between the point \\[0.0, 0.0\\] and \\[200.0, 0.0\\]. Similarly, when fraction is between the second and third keys (i.e. between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues of the second and third keyframes.\n\nFor this example, if the field being interpolated were the translation field of a Poster node parented to the Scene node, the Poster would originally be positioned with its top/left corner at the upper, left corner of the screen. As the animation proceeded from 0% to 40% complete, the Poster would slide horizontally to the right until it's top/left corner was at x=500.0, y=0.0. As the animation continued from 40% to 100% complete, the Poster would slide vertically down until its top/left corner was at x=500.0, y=200.0.\n\nIf the first keyframe has a key percentage greater than zero, then the field value will be equal to the keyValue of the first keyframe until fraction reaches the first keyframe's key percentage. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key percentage less than one, the field value will be set to the keyValue of the last keyframe from when fraction equals the the last keyframe's key percentage and will not change as fraction increases from that value to 1.0.\n\n> While linearly interpolation is used to compute the keyValue's for fraction values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the fraction values computed by the Animation node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.",

Bitmaps can be used for a variety of purposes, such as for sprites, compositing, or as double buffers.\n\nIt stores four color channels: red, green, blue, and alpha, with 32-bits per pixel. They can be any arbitrary size up to 2048x2048. However, the maximum size bitmap uses 16MB of memory, so there are practical memory limitations which would compel smaller bitmap sizes. Coordinates (x,y) for 2D bitmaps have an origin (0,0) at the top left. roBitmap is always offscreen. The top roScreen is the only ifDraw2D surface which is displayed. roBitmap represents something that can be drawn onto, as well as something that can be drawn.\n\nDrawing operations into a roBitmap (or other surface with ifDraw2D interface, such as an [roScreen](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/components/roscreen.md\"roScreen\")) are clipped so the only the part that is within its bounds is rendered. X,Y coordinates that specify a location in a bitmap to render to (for example, as used by DrawObject() or DrawText() ) may be positive or negative. Negative implies that the left and top of the rendered object will be clipped.The same bitmap cannot be used as a source and a destination in a single DrawObject() call.\n\nThere are limitations when using the onscreen bitmap as a source. For example, Alpha blending may not work.\n\nAn empty roBitmap object can be created with CreateObject():\n\n`CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", bitmapProps As Object)`\n\nbitmapProps is an roAssociativeArray with Integers width (Integer), height (Integer), and AlphaEnable (Boolean), and name (String) parameters. The contents of an empty RoBitmap are initialized to zero (transparent black).\n\nExample: `CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", {width:10, height:10, AlphaEnable:false, name:\"MyBitmapName\"})`\n\nAn roBitmap can also load its image data from a file:\n\n`CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", String filename)`\n\n**Example**\n\n```\n' Draw three bitmaps as fast as we can\n'\nScreen=CreateObject(\"roScreen\")\nbm1=CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", \"pkg:/images/myphoto1.jpg\")\nbm2=CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", \"pkg:/images/myphoto2.jpg\")\nbm3=CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", \"pkg:/images/myphoto3.jpg\")\nbmarray=[bm1, bm2, bm3]\nWhile true\n    For each bitmap in bmarray\n        Screen.DrawObject(0,0, bitmap)\n        Screen.Finish()\n    End for\nEnd While\n```\n\n**Example: Double buffering with roBitmap**\n\n```\nscreen1=CreateObject(\"roScreen\")\noff=CreateObject(\"roBitmap\", {width:1280, height:720, AlphaEnable:false})\noff.Clear(white)\ndfDrawImage(off, \"pkg:/images/myimage.png\", 50, 50)\noff.DrawRect(150, 150, 200, 200, &hFF) ' black, alpha: all source\nscreen1.DrawObject(0, 0, off)\nScreen1.Finish()\n```",

Please see [Adding in-channel products](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/quickstart/in-channel-products.md \"Adding in-channel products\") for details on how to create an In-Channel Product and associate it with a channel.

If padding is disabled then the input data must be a multiple of the cipher block length.\n\n> For additional information on the OpenSSL library of symmetric ciphers see: [https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/enc.html](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/enc.html).\n\n**List of supported ciphers**\n\n| Name | Cipher | Key size (bits) | Block size (bits) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| bf-cbc | Blowfish in CBC mode | 128 | 64 |\n| bf | Alias for bf-cbc | 128 | 64 |\n| bf-cfb | Blowfish in CFB mode | 128 | 64 |\n| bf-ecb | Blowfish in ECB mode | 128 | 64 |\n| bf-ofb | Blowfish in OFB mode | 128 | 64 |\n| des-cbc | DES in CBC mode | 56 | 64 |\n| des | Alias for des-cbc | 56 | 64 |\n| des-cfb | DES in CBC mode | 56 | 64 |\n| des-ecb | DES in ECB mode | 56 | 64 |\n| des-ofb | DES in OFB mode | 56 | 64 |\n| des-ede-cbc | Two key triple DES EDE in CBC mode | 80 | 64 |\n| des-ede | Two key triple DES EDE in ECB mode | 80 | 64 |\n| des-ede-cfb | Two key triple DES EDE in CFB mode | 80 | 64 |\n| des-ede-ofb | Two key triple DES EDE in OFB mode | 80 | 64 |\n| des-ede3-cbc | Three key triple DES EDE in CBC mode | 112 | 64 |\n| des-ede3 | Three key triple DES EDE in ECB mode | 112 | 64 |\n| des3 | Alias for des-ede3-cbc | 112 | 64 |\n| des-ede3-cfb | Three key triple DES EDE in CFB mode | 112 | 64 |\n| des-ede3-ofb | Three key triple DES EDE in OFB mode | 112 | 64 |\n| desx | DESX algorithm | approx. 119 | 64 |\n| desx-cbc | DESX in CBC mode | approx. 119 | 64 |\n| aes-\\[128/192/256\\]-cbc | 128/192/256 bit AES in CBC mode | 128,192,256 | 128 |\n| aes-\\[128/192/256\\] | Alias for aes-\\[128/192/256\\]-cbc | 128,192,256 | 128 |\n| aes-\\[128/192/256\\]-cfb | 128/192/256 bit AES in 128 bit CFB mode | 128,192,256 | 128 |\n| aes-\\[128/192/256\\]-cfb1 | 128/192/256 bit AES in 1 bit CFB mode | 128,192,256 | 128 |\n| aes-\\[128/192/256\\]-cfb8 | 128/192/256 bit AES in 8 bit CFB mode | 128,192,256 | 128 |\n| aes-\\[128/192/256\\]-ecb | 128/192/256 bit AES in ECB mode | 128,192,256 | 128 |\n| aes-\\[128/192/256\\]-ofb | 128/192/256 bit AES in OFB mode | 128,192,256 | 128 |",

For example, \"roList\" maintains a list of objects. If an Integer is added to roList, it will be automatically wrapped in an roInt by the language interpreter. When a function that expects a BrightScript Component as a parameter is passed an int, BrightScript automatically creates the equivalent BrightScript Component.\n*   If any object exposes the ifInt interface, that object can be used in any expression that expects an intrinsic value. For example, in this way an roTouchEvent can be used as an integer whose value is the userid of the roTouchEvent.\n\n> If o is an roInt, then the following statements have the following effects\n> \n> print o ' prints o.GetInt()\n> \n> i%=o ' assigns the integer i% the value of o.GetInt()\n> \n> k=o 'presumably k is dynamic typed, so it becomes another reference to the roInt o\n> \n> o=5 'this is NOT the same as o.SetInt(5). Instead it releases o, and 'changes the type of o to Integer (o is dynamically typed).

Registry data is removed only when the application explicitly removes it, the user uninstalls the application, which remove the registry for the application, or the user performs a factory reset, which removes the registry for all applications.\n\nAccess to the registry is available through the roRegistry object. This object is created with no parameters:\n\n`CreateObject(\"roRegistry\")`\n\nThere is a separate registry for each [developer ID](/docs/developer-program/publishing/packaging-channels.md#step-3-run-the-genkey-utility-to-create-a-signing-key \"developer ID\"). This allows multiple applications to use the registry without being able to read or modify the registry from other applications. If desired, a single registry can be shared across multiple applications by using the same developer ID to package the applications. This is the conventional way that an \"application suite\" with shared preferences and other shared information should work. Each registry is divided into sections which are specified by the developer for organization and grouping of attributes. Methods in ifRegistry are provided to list the sections in the registry and to provide access to the data in each section.\n\n> The maximum size of each zlib-compressed application registry is **16K bytes**. Channels should minimize the amount of data stored in the registry and the frequency in which they update it.\n> \n> Use the **ifRegistry.GetSpaceAvailable()** function to check the number of bytes available in the registry.\n\nThe Registry also supports the use of a special transient registry section. A registry section named \"Transient\" can be used to store attributes that have the lifetime of a single boot. Within a specific boot session, these values will be persistent to the application and stored as any other registry value. Whenever the user reboots the Roku Streaming Player, all \"Transient\" registry sections are removed and the values no longer persist. This technique is useful for caching data to minimize network access, yet still ensuring that this data is always fresh after a system reboot.\n\nThe registry is encrypted, and updates are relatively performance intensive and should be used sparingly. Note that all writes to the registry are delayed, and not committed to non-volatile storage until ifRegistry.Flush() or ifRegistrySection.Flush() is explicitly called. The platform may choose opportune times to flush data on its own, but no application is technically correct unless it explicitly calls Flush() at appropriate times. Flushing the registry is a relatively time-consuming operation, so it should be done as infrequently as possible. The Registry data is stored in a fault tolerant manner by preserving a backup for each write which is automatically rolled-back in the event of a failure.",

            "description": "The roScreen component provides a full screen drawing surface that can be stacked and that you can receive input events from.\n\nYou will need at least one roScreen component in your 2D game application to draw on and get events from. The origin (0,0) is the top left corner of the screen. The pixels are always RGBA 32 bits. Multiple roScreen components stack, and like other screen components only the top screen is viewable and gets events. An roScreen that is not the top most screen can still be drawn to.\n\n> Once an roScreen is created, the display stack enters \"Game Mode\", and other screen components cannot be used. Screensavers will also be disabled and will appear as a black screen in its place. Other screen components cannot be intermixed with roScreens as the roScreen display stack is maintained independently from the main screen component display stack. When the final roScreen component is closed, other screen components can be used again.\n\nWhen the roScreen constructor is called, an optional double buffer flag, and an optional resolution can be passed. If the screen is double buffered, two buffers are fully allocated when CreateObject() succeeds. If the screen is single buffered only one buffer is allocated and the \"front\" and \"back\" buffers in method descriptions below are the same buffer. When a screen is created with a different resolution than the output display, it is scaled automatically to the output display resolution.\n\nTo maintain proper aspect ratio, and take care of the different pixel aspect ratio in HD vs SD; there is a fixed set of bitmap resolutions that are allowed to be created for screens:\n\n**HD mode screensizes**\n\n*   1280x720PAR=1:1 (default for HD)\n*   854x480 PAR=1:1 useful for higher performance HD games, also for 640x480 games\n*   940x480 PAR=1.1:1 used for displaying a RokuSD (720x480) games\n\n**SD mode screensizes**\n\n*   720x480 PAR=1.1:1 (default for SD)\n*   640x480 PAR=1:1 (used for 640x480 games)\n*   854x626 PAR=1:1 (used for 854x480 HD games)\n\nThe screen dimensions correspond to the drawable area that applications see. The dimensions were chosen so that applications do not need to compensate for screen aspect ratio or pixel aspect ratio.\n\nIt's likely that when porting games from other platforms, the active game area may be smaller and correspond to more traditional dimensions. In this case, the application can supply letterbox or pillarbox artwork and use an [roRegion](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/components/roregion.md\"roRegion\") to define the active area. The roRegion will translate and clip graphics to the proper area for the game. Similarly, roRegions are used to describe the left and right pillars for an SD game in HD mode, or the upper and lower letterbox regions for an HD game in SD mode.\n\nGames that require more performance should use smaller dimensions. Games should run in HD and SD mode. The screensizes HD 854x480 paired with SD 854x626 and HD 940x480 paired with SD 720x480 were designed for this purpose.\n\nThe game creates a single active game roRegion to do all graphics operations in. roRegions for pillar or letter boxes are used to fill the rest of the screen area depending on if the app is in HD or SD mode. Please refer to the dfSetupDisplayRegions() function in [v30/bslDefender.brs](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/language/component-architecture.mdv30bslcorebrs \"v30/bslDefender.brs\") for help in setting up the drawable regions in screen scaling.\n\nThere are some useful rules of thumb to be aware of to get the best performance when rendering your games:\n\n*   Alpha enabled regions are expensive to render\n\nIt is a requirement that the destination be alpha enabled in order for non-rectangular sprites to be properly rendered with transparency. However the sprite used for a background would typically have all pixels be fully nontransparent. Since alpha blending is expensive, a quick way to blit the background in this scenario is to first disable alpha on the screen, manually draw the background, and then enable alpha for the screen before drawing the rest of the sprites.\n\n*   Use smaller resolution images wherever possible. Scaling a large image down at run time is expensive with no benefit to the user\n*   Rendering text with DrawText() is expensive\n\nFortunately, many of these calls are redundant and can be eliminated. The static text for a particular level can be drawn on the background once and this newly created background can be used for refreshing the screen. This will eliminate almost all text redraws.\n\nA screen can be created with one of three constructors. If it is created with no parameters, the screen will be single buffered, and its output resolution will match the current display resolution (if the current resolution is specified in the manifest file ui\\_resolutions entry, otherwise the size will be 720p).\n\n`CreateObject(\"roScreen\")`\n\nIf a single parameter is passed, it is a Boolean that indicates if the screen is double buffered or not. See SwapBuffers():\n\n`CreateObject(\"roScreen\", true) ' double buffered screen`\n\nIf four parameters are passed, the last two specify the screen's resolution. The dimensions must be one of the screen sizes specified above:\n\n`CreateObject(\"roScreen\", true, 720, 480) ' db & SD res`\n\n**Example: Display an image**\n\n```\nScreen=CreateObject(\"roScreen\")\ndfDrawImage(screen, \"myphoto.jpg\",0,0)\nScreen.Finish()\n```\n\n**Example: Alpha blending**\n\n```\nwhite=&hFFFFFFFF\nscreen0=CreateObject(\"roScreen\")\nscreen0.SetAlphaEnable(true)\nscreen0.Clear(white)\nscreen0.DrawRect(100,100, screen0.GetWidth()-200, screen0.GetHeight()-200, &h80)\n' &h80 is black with a 50% alpha mix (RGBA)\nscreen0.finish()\n```",

This must be called before making a request. The developer can also use the Roku standard cert bundle (which contains certificates for most common signing authorities) stored in common:/certs/ca-bundle.crt; or download the CA certificate [here](https://github.com/rokudev/ca-certificate/blob/master/ca-bundle.crt).\n\nThe web server can authenticate that the requested connection is from a Roku Streaming Player and that the request is from your application by taking the following actions:\n\n*   Add the Roku CA certificate to the web server's certificate authorities keychain, download the CA certificate.\n*   Configure your web server to reject any connection that does not have a valid client certificate.\n*   Check the X-Roku-Reserved-Dev-Id header in the request. It should contain the Developer ID of your application. If it does not, another application on the Roku is attempting to access the server, and the request is rejected.\n\n**Example**\n\nIn order for your web server to perform the steps above to authenticate your Roku Streaming Player, your application needs to call the following functions before performing any https requests:\n\n```\nobject.SetCertificatesFile(\"common:/certs/ca-bundle.crt\")\nobject.AddHeader(\"X-Roku-Reserved-Dev-Id\", \"\")\nobject.InitClientCertificates()\n```",
