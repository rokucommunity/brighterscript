# Constants
You can use the `const` keyword to declare constant values. These values cannot be changed at runtime. Constant references will be inlined at compile-time, which is very efficient (similar to how [enums](enums.md) work).

**NOTE:** These are not to be confused with the conditional compile `#const` statements, which are a totally different thing.

## Basic usage
Consts can be defined at the root level of files, and are scoped the same way as functions.
```BrighterScript
const GREETING_MESSAGE = "Hello world"
sub main()
    print GREETING_MESSAGE
end sub
```
transpiles to
```BrightScript
sub main()
    print "Hello world"
end sub
```

## Namespaced Consts
Consts can be defined within namespaces, and accessed like a property.

```BrighterScript
namespace networking
    const BASE_URL = "https://your-app.com/api/v1"
    sub printBaseUrl()
		'namespace-relative access is allowed
        print BASE_URL
    end sub
end namespace
sub main()
    print networking.BASE_URL
end sub
```

transpiles to

```BrightScript
sub networking_printBaseUrl()
    'namespace-relative access is allowed
    print "https://your-app.com/api/v1"
end sub

sub main()
    print "https://your-app.com/api/v1"
end sub
```

## Complex objects
Constants can contain complex objects or arrays as well, but keep in mind that these are inlined at compile-time, so it is not recommended to reach into these objects for specific values all the time.

non-primitive const values will be wrapped with parentheses when transpiled.

```BrighterScript
namespace networking
	const HEADERS = {
		"Authorization": "Basic",
		"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true"
	}
	const METHODS = [
	    "GET",
	    "POST",
	    "PUT",
	    "DELETE"
	]
end namespace
sub main()
    print networking.HEADERS
    print networking.METHODS
end sub
```
**Transpiled:**
```brightscript
sub main()
    print ({
        "Authorization": "Basic"
        "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true"
    })
    print ([
        "GET"
        "POST"
        "PUT"
        "DELETE"
    ])
end sub
```

## Referencing other constants
Constants can reference other constants (as long as there is no circular reference). You can even use template strings!

```brighterscript
const BASE_URL = "https://api.domain.com"
const LOGIN_PATH = "/login"

const LOGIN_URL = BASE_URL + LOGIN_PATH

const ERROR_URL = `${BASE_URL}/some/error`
sub main()
    print LOGIN_URL
    print ERROR_URL
end sub
```

transpiles to

```brightscript
sub main()
    print ("https://api.domain.com" + "/login")
    print (bslib_toString("https://api.domain.com") + "/some/error")
end sub
```
